Chapter One:
Introductions
Magic asks for a lot of imagination. It is not just waving around a wand and blurting out odd words. It requires a mind, set to believe things he might never see, energy he may feel or foul with negative thoughts.
Beware,for the arcane in you might manifest wrongly.
So focus, stay on the path you feel is righteous, and take it with a little wit, for serious mages never have gained the knowledge that connects nature with the arcane !
Chapter Two:
Survival
On your journey troughout the world to study the arcane, you will most likely encounter dangerous foes. There are three nifty basic spells that can aid you in preventing early death.
Augolustra:
Calling forth a small combustion, propulsing a stream of hot air towards your foe. 
Stay steady, articulate well, and give a little left-flick with your wand to keep your enemy at bay.
Expelliarmus
Call forth a stream of red arcane dust that disarms your foe.
Stay steady, articulate well, and left-flick with your wand when ready to disarm your foe.
Contego Aspida
Protect yourself from Damage.
An upward slash from bottom left to top right while, in one sigh, orate the spell. This should conjure blue spheres that absorb incoming damage.
Chapter Three:
First Aid
May you have harmed a friend or yourself while messing around with our basic survival spell, remember then that there is always aid to be given for small wounds and barely broken bones.
