Do dogs spawn into the world lying down if they are already sitting.
Time to spend sitting (in ticks) before dogs lie down.
Range for target to get to dog before dog gets up (in blocks)
Poses for lying down that are enabled. If the mod can't find compatible poses, it will randomly pick one set.
Allow the mod to attempt to add support for mod wolves? (Still doesn't allow support for Doggy Talents)
