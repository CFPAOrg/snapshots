Bypass All Items
If set to true, smite damage bypasses all item effects (eg. infinity armor's special protection, soulbound enchant, curse of vanishing, etc)\n \n
Cooldown
How long a player is considered to be 'in combat' after taking damage from, or dealing damage to, another player (in seconds)\nIf they disconnect before this amount of time has passed, they die\n \n
Death Message
Sets the death message for when someone dies via this mod. %s is a tag that is replaced by the name of the killed player\n \n
Show Messages
If set to true, sends players messages telling them when then enter and leave combat\nI very highly suggest leaving this set to true\n \n
Smite Command
If set to true, OP players can access the /smite <playername> command\nAs a side note, OP players are immune to smite, so if all players are OP, this command (and this entire mod) does nothing\n \n
Lightning Effect
If set to true, players who are killed by this mod seem like they're hit by lightning (the lightning itself doesn't actually deal any damage or start any fires)\nWhy would you ever disable this?\n \n
