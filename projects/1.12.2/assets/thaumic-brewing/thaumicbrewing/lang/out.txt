For better or worse, these foul concoctions are even more potent than before.
Extended Basic Potions
Several types of brewed potions can have the duration of their effects extended by adding some glowstone dust to the mix.  How do I recreate that with alchemy?
Strangely enough, Lux essentia was the answer.  I wouldn't have expected it to have time-related effects, but then again it is found in the glowstone that brewing uses.  Perhaps there's some unseen connection between the two arts.
Extended Advanced Potions
It stands to reason that if basic potions can have their effects extended, then advanced potions should as well.  Only one way to find out.
As with my earlier experiments, a little bit of Lux has extended the effects of my advanced potions.
Extended Debilitating Potions
Perhaps these debilitating potions can have their effects extended as well.  Assuming, of course, that I'm willing to partake in that kind of research.
Light is a strange thing to be adding to such dark mixtures, but alchemy doesn't always conform to our expectations.  Nonetheless, it accomplished my goals here.
Splash Potions
Sometimes I don't want to drink a potion myself, but rather apply its effects to another.  At a brewing stand I'd add a pinch of gunpowder to cause the flask to burst.  How can I recreate that effect using essentia?
The gunpowder angle was a red herring, but I've found my answer.  By adding some Aqua essentia to the any potion, I can cause it to splash readily upon contact with a surface.
Lingering Potions
Some rare brews can have their effects linger in a cloud upon exposure to the air, but the main ingredient for that, dragon's breath, isn't the easiest thing to come by.  I'm going to need another solution if I want to replicate this.
A little outside-the-box thinking has brought to me the answer: Spiritus!  Just as the spirits of the lost linger, so too shall any potions that I infuse with it.
