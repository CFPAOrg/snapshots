Thaumic Brewing
Thaumic Brewing
Brewing is an interesting art.  It doesn't appear to utilize thaumaturgy, but the results it produces are undeniably special.  I suspect that, with some effort, I could recreate its effects more efficiently using alchemical principles.
Basic Potions
By studying some of the more basic products of brewing, I should be able to learn how to recreate them using essentia.
Success!  I've devised several recipes for creating potions with alchemy, using Alkimia essentia as a binder.  Now to see how I can expand on that.
Advanced Potions
I've been unable so far to recreate some of the more complex brewing recipes using a water base.  Perhaps augmenting existing potions will get me the results I'm after... 
My theory was correct.  By using an existing potion as a catalyst, I'm now able to create more complex types of potions.
Debilitating Potions
Like thaumaturgy, brewing has a dark side.  Is it worth recreating that as well?
As I suspected, a simple inversion of effect using Perditio essentia was enough to turn helpful potions into debilitating ones.  Not that I'd recommend actually drinking any of them.
Powerful Basic Potions
Brewing allows for several types of potions to be given an enhanced effect with the addition of redstone dust.  Perhaps that amplification process can be reproduced alchemically as well.
A splash of Potentia did the trick.  That shouldn't surprise me, given how chock full of the stuff redstone is, but I confess that I'd expected it to be a bit more... complicated.
Powerful Advanced Potions
I wonder if advanced potions can have their effects amplified in the same way that basic potions can.  This warrants further experimentation.
Just like basic potions, a touch of Potentia was enough to make my advanced potions more powerful.
Powerful Debilitating Potions
Can my debilitating potions be made more powerful?  Is it worth the cost?
