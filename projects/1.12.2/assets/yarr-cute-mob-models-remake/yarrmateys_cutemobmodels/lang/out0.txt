This will turn most of the mod on or off. Everything but the Ghast Sister's rendering will be disabled if it's off.
Enable Mod
Enable special options
This will enable special options like scaled hitboxes for most mobs, instead of just replacing them graphically. This decreases compatibility with other mods like mobtalker, since the mobs are replaced with a new one. Once the mod's uninstalled, these mobs will be deleted instead of reverting to original.
Human Mobs Models
Replaces the models with more blocky minecraft-y versions of themselves.
Separate entities
This will spawn the cute mob model enemies as variations of the original mobs instead of replacing the original ones' models, so both can coexist. Note, this disables the regular mob replacement. Requires minecraft to be restarted.
Replace animals
This will replace animals with their humanoid versions. In case you're not comfortable with killing them for food, you can turn it off.
Starting Entity ID
Entity ID offset. This will change the ID number for Ghast Sister/GhastS enemy and any additional mobs such as the separated mobs.
