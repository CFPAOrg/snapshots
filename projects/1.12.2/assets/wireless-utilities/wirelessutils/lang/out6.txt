Using augments, it's possible to wirelessly send fluids to a large area!
Augments can also be used to send fluids into items in inventories or to place fluids directly in the world.
When an Invert Augment is present it will extract fluids instead of sending them.
The Positional Condenser transfers fluids to specific positions.
Place a Positional Card in one of the Positional Condenser's slots to tell it to send fluid to that block.
Using augments, it's possible to add more than one Positional Card.
Augments can also let you send fluids farther away or at a greater rate.
