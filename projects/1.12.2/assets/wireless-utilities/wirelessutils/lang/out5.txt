The Directional Charger charges things in a direction.
Initially, the Directional Charger only charges one block in front of it in the direction it's facing.
Using augments, it's possible to wirelessly charge a large area!
An augment can also be used to allow the Directional Charger to charge items inside of chests, drawers, and other such blocks.
The Positional Charger charges things in specific positions.
Place a Positional Card in one of the Positional Charger's slots to tell it to charge that block.
Using augments, it's possible to add more than one Positional Card.
Augments can also help you charge blocks farther away from the Positional Charger. Eventually, even across dimensions!
An augment can also be used to allow the Positional Charger to charge items inside of chests, drawers, and other such blocks.
The Directional Condenser transfers fluids in a direction.
Initially, the Directional Condenser only condenses fluid into the block directly in front of it.
