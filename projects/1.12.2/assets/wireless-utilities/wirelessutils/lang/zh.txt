Fluxed Pearl
The pearl seems to be reacting
to the clouds above.
Adding redstone to an Ender Pearl
seems to have reduced its capability
for teleportation but given it
strange powers over flux.
Coating an Ender Pearl with Redstone muffles its teleportation abilities.
Instead, these pearls create a pulse of flux when they hit a block.
Fluxed Pearls bounce when they hit slime blocks, and they can be fired from Dispensers.
Charged Pearl
A Fluxed Pearl that has been exposed to a lot of energy.\n
Rumor has it that Charged Pearls were first discovered when a frustrated miner threw one into the heart of a storm cloud.
Quenched Pearl
Scorched Pearl
Crystallized Void Pearl
Smashing a Void Pearl up against an Ender Crystal has somehow crystallized the Void Pearl itself.
Void Pearls in this state become very stable, and they can't be used to capture creatures anymore. However, any creatures previously trapped inside become somehow easier to access.
Void Pearl
Contains: %s
Baby %s
Health: %s
Value: %s
Empty
Throwing a Scorched Pearl into an End Portal has filled it with nothingness.
The void seeks to be filled, and to that end, it seems to suck up any creature it comes into contact with.
Stabilized Ender Pearls behave similarly to Fluxed Pearls, in that they can be bounced and fired from Dispensers.
If a Stabilized Ender Pearl is shot from a Dispenser rather than thrown, it will teleport a nearby creature to itself when it lands.
The stabilization also seems to have made the process safer.

Augment Base
Dispenser Augment
This augment allows Desublimators
to dispense items into the world
rather than merely dropping them.
Requires an air block at the
target location.
World Augment
This augment allows certain machines
to modify the world directly, such
as by placing a fluid.
Block Augment
This augment allows Desublimators to
place and break blocks, rather than
merely dropping and picking up items
as they do with a World Augment.
Auxiliary Condenser Augment

condenser to a machine, filling
that machine's tank with fluid
in exchange for energy.

resources to or from the
surrounding machinery, as well as
close off sides from external access.
Crop Augment
This augment allows certain machines
to interact with crops, such as by harvesting
the crops or using bonemeal on them.
Crop Augments will also harvest trees
so long as they have the base of the
tree within their work area.
Inventory Augment
This augment allows a machine to
operate on items within the inventories
of blocks in addition to the blocks
themselves.
Chunk Loading Augment
This augment causes a machine to
force all of its targets to stay
loaded at all times as long as the
machine itself remains loaded.
Target Slot Augment
This augment increases the number of
slots available for Positional Cards
in Positional machines.
Slot Augments cannot be removed
while cards are stored in the
slots they added.
Range Augment
This augment increases the maximum
distance that a machine can affect.
Interdimensional
Range Augments cannot be removed
when a target requires the Range
Augment to be within range.
Filter Augment
This augment prevents
matching items from being
inserted into the inventory
of machines.
When held in your off-hand,
this augment will stop you
from picking up items that
match its filters.

Capacity Augment
This augment greatly increases the
quantity of resources that a machine
can store in its internal buffer.
This augment cannot be removed when
doing so would make the fluid tank
too small to hold its contents.

The Directional Charger charges things in a direction.
Initially, the Directional Charger only charges one block in front of it in the direction it's facing.
Using augments, it's possible to wirelessly charge a large area!
An augment can also be used to allow the Directional Charger to charge items inside of chests, drawers, and other such blocks.
The Positional Charger charges things in specific positions.
Place a Positional Card in one of the Positional Charger's slots to tell it to charge that block.
Using augments, it's possible to add more than one Positional Card.
Augments can also help you charge blocks farther away from the Positional Charger. Eventually, even across dimensions!

The Directional Vaporizer vaporizes entities in a direction.
The behavior of a Vaporizer depends entirely on its installed Module. Without a Module, it won't run.
Modules allow a Vaporizer to teleport entities, kill them, spawn copies, or to push them around.
Using augments, it's possible to increase a Vaporizer's range and further customize its capabilities.
