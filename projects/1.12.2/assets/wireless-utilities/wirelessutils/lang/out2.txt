Rumor has it that Charged Pearls were first discovered when a frustrated miner threw one into the heart of a storm cloud.
Quenched Pearl
Scorched Pearl
Crystallized Void Pearl
Smashing a Void Pearl up against an Ender Crystal has somehow crystallized the Void Pearl itself.
Void Pearls in this state become very stable, and they can't be used to capture creatures anymore. However, any creatures previously trapped inside become somehow easier to access.

Empty
Throwing a Scorched Pearl into an End Portal has filled it with nothingness.
The void seeks to be filled, and to that end, it seems to suck up any creature it comes into contact with.
Stabilized Ender Pearls behave similarly to Fluxed Pearls, in that they can be bounced and fired from Dispensers.
If a Stabilized Ender Pearl is shot from a Dispenser rather than thrown, it will teleport a nearby creature to itself when it lands.
The stabilization also seems to have made the process safer.
