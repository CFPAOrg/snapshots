cfg.lines=Entity Lines
cfg.entities.players=Entities: Players
cfg.entities.players.tooltip=Other players
cfg.entities.creatures=Entites: Creatures
cfg.entities.creatures.tooltip=Non-hostile creatures / animals, including water animals.
cfg.entities.monsters=Entities: Monsters
cfg.entities.monsters.tooltip=Hostile monsters.
cfg.entities.other=Entities: Other living
cfg.entities.other.tooltip=Other living entities (including villagers), but excluding ambient mobs
cfg.entities.enable=Enable
cfg.entities.enable.tooltip=Enable highlighting for this category?
cfg.entities.max_distance=Maximum distance
cfg.entities.max_distance.tooltip=Distance beyond which entities of this type will be ignored. Note that servers often don't send entities beyond ~128 blocks away (8 chunks); often even less. There is also no point in setting this beyond render distance×16 as well.
cfg.entities.max_vertical_distance=Maximum vertical distance
cfg.entities.max_vertical_distance.tooltip=Vertical (Y-component only) distance beyond which entities of this type will be ignored. In other words, if the entity is this many blocks below or above you, it will not be tracked.
cfg.entities.color.red=Red
cfg.entities.color.red.tooltip=Red component for drawing this category's color
cfg.entities.color.green=Green
cfg.entities.color.green.tooltip=Green component for drawing this category's color
cfg.entities.color.blue=Blue
cfg.entities.color.blue.tooltip=Blue component for drawing this category's color
cfg.entities.players.ignore_fake=Ignore fake players
cfg.entities.players.ignore_fake.tooltip=Whether the mode should attempt to filter out "fake" players (NPCs used on some servers). This uses the player list to check if the player exists, so it may not work on all servers. Turn this off if some (real) players are not getting tracked.
cfg.entities.players.respect_team_colors=Respect team colors
cfg.entities.players.respect_team_colors.tooltip=Whether players should be highlighted with their team's color (if they have one) instead of the one configured above.†
cfg.entities.players.display_mode=Display mode
cfg.entities.players.display_mode.tooltip=EVERYONE: show all players; TEAM_ONLY: display only your team; ENEMY_ONLY: show only enemies. Players without a team are always displayed regardless of this setting. If you don't have a team this option has no effect.
cfg.lines.enable=Enable
cfg.lines.enable.tooltip=Whether lines should be drawn at all. This is the value applied on MC startup. Using the keybind only temporarily switches this value.
cfg.lines.smooth=Smooth lines
cfg.lines.smooth.tooltip=Whether a form of anti-aliasing should be applied to lines drawn.
cfg.lines.infinite=Infinite lines
cfg.lines.infinite.tooltip=Currently has little effect.
cfg.lines.width=Line width
cfg.lines.width.tooltip=The width of lines (in pixels). For non-smooth lines 1 is fine for most resolutions; for smooth lines it's better to have this greater.
cfg.lines.camera_distance=Distance from camera
cfg.lines.camera_distance.tooltip=In first person, how far ahead will the 'center' where all the lines come from be projected? Negative values look weird (because it puts it behind the camera), but some may like it.
