Enable
Enable highlighting for this category?
Maximum distance
Distance beyond which entities of this type will be ignored. Note that servers often don't send entities beyond ~128 blocks away (8 chunks); often even less. There is also no point in setting this beyond render distance×16 as well.
Maximum vertical distance
Vertical (Y-component only) distance beyond which entities of this type will be ignored. In other words, if the entity is this many blocks below or above you, it will not be tracked.
Red
Red component for drawing this category's color
Green
Green component for drawing this category's color
Blue
Blue component for drawing this category's color
Ignore fake players
Whether the mode should attempt to filter out "fake" players (NPCs used on some servers). This uses the player list to check if the player exists, so it may not work on all servers. Turn this off if some (real) players are not getting tracked.
Respect team colors
Whether players should be highlighted with their team's color (if they have one) instead of the one configured above.†
Display mode
EVERYONE: show all players; TEAM_ONLY: display only your team; ENEMY_ONLY: show only enemies. Players without a team are always displayed regardless of this setting. If you don't have a team this option has no effect.
Enable
Whether lines should be drawn at all. This is the value applied on MC startup. Using the keybind only temporarily switches this value.
Smooth lines
Whether a form of anti-aliasing should be applied to lines drawn.
Infinite lines
Currently has little effect.
Line width
The width of lines (in pixels). For non-smooth lines 1 is fine for most resolutions; for smooth lines it's better to have this greater.
