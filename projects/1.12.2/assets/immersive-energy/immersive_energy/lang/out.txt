The §lHeafty Wrench§r can be enchanted with §lUnbreaking§r, §lMending§r, §lEfficancy§r, and §lFire Aspect§r. §lUnbreaking§r works as normal. §lMending§r will slowly repair the §lHefty Wrench§r for free, even charging it when it is fully repaired, up to 1600. §lEfficancy§r will reduce the energy cost of the upgrades by 300 per level. §lFire Aspect§r, with the §lThermal Upgrade§r, will add an additional 1 fire damage and 4 seconds burn time per level.
