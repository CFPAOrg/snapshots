Solar Panels
Metallic Photosynthesis!
The §lSolar Panel Array§r is the base of all the §lSolar Panels§r, and one of the most complex parts yet. By it self it can't do anything, it is instead used in the crafting of the <link;solar_panel;§o§nPortable_Solar_Panel§r;3>.
The §lSolar Panels§r are too complex to be made by hand and require a dedicated blueprint. This blueprint is used for all things solar.
The aluminum keeps the <link;solar_panel;§o§nSolar_Panel_Array§r;0> relatively light, but lacks any useful way of storing and extracting energy.
