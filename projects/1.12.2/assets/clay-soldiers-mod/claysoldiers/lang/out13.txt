Pegasi
A variant of horses, just horses with wings. Due to their additional body parts they have the special ability to fly around whilst being ridden.\n\nWhen too high up - as they only can fly up to 2 blocks above ground - they will not come crashing down, instead they will slow down their fall up until either they reach ground or they can fly again.\n\nBe careful of roofing: a pegasus seems to ignore its riders' pleas as they're suffocating.\n\nThey have the same stats as {link:horses|mounts:horse}.
Turtles
These are one of the slowest mounts, but most of them have higher amounts of health and their special ability is being able to swim on water. Each type of turtle has specific values of health, speed and wether or not it can withstand fire (fireproof), depending on the material it is made of.\n\n§7-§1Cobblestone:\n§8  40 HP, 80%% speed\n§7-§1Mossy Cobblestone:\n§8  45 HP, 70%% speed\n§7-§1Netherrack:\n§8  35 HP, 80%% speed, fireproof\n§7-§1Melon:\n§8  25 HP, 90%% speed\n§7-§1Sandstone:\n§8  30 HP, 80%% speed\n§7-§1End Stone:\n§8  45 HP, 80%% speed\n§7-§1Pumpkin:\n§8  25 HP, 90%% speed\n§7-§1Lapis Lazuli:\n§8  35 HP, 90%% speed\n§7-§1Cake:\n§8  30 HP, 90%% speed\n§7-§1§kKawako§r§1:\n§8  §k5§r§80 HP, §k85§r§8%% speed, §kpoison§r\n  §8§kresist§r
Bunnies
A simple, small mount, that can jump as high as a fence, so be careful to not let them escape. They come in all 16 wool colors!\n\nAs they do not have varying stats, the health value is 20 HP and speed is 100%% for all of them.
Geckos
Geckos, which are made out of woods, are like spiders in regards to their special ability: they can climb up walls. Other than that, these are pretty simple mounts.\n\nAs they do not have varying stats, the health value is 20 HP and speed is 100%% for all of them.
Miscellaneous
Disruptors
If you want to get rid of any soldiers, mounts or companions, this is a very handy utility. The disruptor kills all clay entities in a radius of 32 blocks.\n\nEach use will damage the disruptor by 1 point and apply a cooldown of 2 seconds, after which you can use it again.\n\nThere are 3 types of disruptors you can craft, defined by the material used, each more durable than the other:\n§7-§1Clay (32 uses)\n§7-§1Hardened Clay (128 uses)\n§7-§1Obsidian (∞ uses)\n\nYou have several modes to choose from whilst using this device, determining what's getting disrupted. To change the mode, simply scroll up or down with your mouse wheel whilst sneaking and holding the disruptor in your hand, where you'll see the current mode active (see screenshot below). Following modes are available:\n§7-§1All clay creatures\n§7-§1Soldiers\n§7-§1Mounts\n§7-§1Companions\n§7-§1Clay Blocks\n§7-§1All the things\nThe default mode of any disruptor upon crafting will be "All clay creatures"\n\nAs mentioned, you can actually break clay blocks in the world to gather more clay. The radius of destruction will be 4 blocks and each destroyed block will damage the disruptor by 1 point.
