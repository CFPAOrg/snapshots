If you have lots of leftover teams and just want to convert them back to regular, light gray {link:clay soldiers|upgrades:baseSoldier}, you can use a water bucket in a crafting grid to wash them.\n\nIf you have a cauldron with water in it, you can also wash them by using it whilst holding the dolls in your hand. Each use will consume 1/3rd of the cauldron water. You can wash up to 16 (full stack) dolls at once with this method!
Brick Soldier Dolls
If soldiers get too hot - either by burning to death or smelting a doll in a furnace - they may end up turning into bricked versions of themselves.\n\nThe only way to bring those back to life is with a ghast tear, either via soldier with the tear as an {link:upgrade|upgrades:ghasttear} or in a crafting grid as shown below (ghast tear is not consumed; shapeless; they'll become regular {link:clay soldiers|upgrades:baseSoldier}).
Using the crafting grid to revert the brick dolls to their softer form, you can put another doll in it, this way the resulting doll will be the same variant as the one in the grid. Neither the ghast tear nor the soldier doll will be consumed and the recipe is shapeless.
Mounts
Mounts
Those little critters can be ridden into battle by soldiers. Each type of mount has different special abilities that aid a soldier to traverse different kind of terrain.\n\nAs with soldier dolls, you need to use these doll(s) on a face of a block to place them (all at once when not sneaking, one at a time whilst sneaking).\n\nIf an enemy soldier attacks the rider of a mount, there is a chance that the mount will take the damage instead of the rider.\n\nIf the rider is killed, the mount is free for the taking again, even by enemies.\n\nPS: when talking about speed stats, keep in mind the amounts are percentages and 100%% speed is 0.3 blocks per second.
Horses
Horses are a basic mount, thus do not have any special abilities. Each type of horse has specific values of health, speed and wether or not it can breathe underwater (amphibian), depending on the material it is made of.\n\n§7-§1Dirt:\n§8  35 HP, 105%% speed\n§7-§1Sand:\n§8  30 HP, 110%% speed\n§7-§1Gravel:\n§8  45 HP, 95%% speed\n§7-§1Snow:\n§8  40 HP, 100%% speed\n§7-§1Grass:\n§8  20 HP, 120%% speed\n§7-§1Lapis Lazuli:\n§8  35 HP, 120%% speed, amphibian\n§7-§1Clay:\n§8  35 HP, 110%% speed, amphibian\n§7-§1Carrot:\n§8  35 HP, 120%% speed, amphibian\n§7-§1Soul Sand:\n§8  35 HP, 115%% speed\n§7-§1Cake:\n§8  35 HP, 140%% speed\n§7-§1§kNightmare§r§1:\n§8  §k5§r§80 HP, 1§k6§r§80%% speed, §kfireproof§r
