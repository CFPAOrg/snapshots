To get started with multiblocks, which is the act of transforming a set of blocks placed into the world into another set of blocks, you need a catalyst. The usual catalyst will be the wildwood staff, along with whatever power is stored in it that the recipes will ask for. Arrange the set of blocks in the world as shown by the recipe input grid, and rightclick the center of the arrangement with the catalyst. If the catalyst is not a wildwood staff, then it is a consumable item.
