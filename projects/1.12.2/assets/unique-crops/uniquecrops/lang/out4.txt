These plants are pretty crafty! They're the next step you need to get to in order to craft the other seeds. You'll need 9 of them in a 3x3 square, with the center one being grown last. After that, it is just a matter of dropping the desired ingredients on top of the center plant, upon which it will automatically try crafting the output once all 9 plants have the ingredients. The order you put the ingredients in doesn't matter.
These crops like to grow together with other crops of their type, in groups of even numbers divisible by 4. Any crop with an odd-numbered of friends, including themselves, will fail to grow. Harvesting them will yield waffles, part of a delicious breakfast diet.
Thorny plants that grows well in darkness, they will shrink away from bright light sources. Additionally, they will try to spread to adjacent dirt/farmland once fully grown. Fully matured crops will snare and slow down any players that walk through them.
Pixelly, pixelly pixel plants. Starting from the default 16x16 textures, these crops will gradually get more and more high definition as they grow.
Very bedrocky crops, these can only be planted and grown at below 10y. Once fully grown, they will gradually transform all bedrock around and below them into Dark Blocks, which can be picked up by shift-rightclicking them with a Ender Snooker. If mobGriefing gamemode is off, then the crops will instead yield the Dark blocks when rightclicked. The dark blocks have potential use for recipes, and are also very good witherproof blocks.
Crafted using anvils as part of the seed recipe, these are the renewable versions of anvils. To grow, they must have items with durability nearby. The higher the durability of these items, the better the chance they'll advance a stage. This process will consume 10%% of that item's durability. Once fully grown, right clicking it with any repairable item will restore 50%% of that item's max durability.
