These imperius crops are known for their strong anti mob spawning policies. Growing them up requires killing the random mobs they spawn, though. Once fully grown, they will prevent mobs from spawning in a 3x3 chunk area around them.
Lacusia crops will transport items from a to b, only along a very flat surface. When a crop next to an inventory is given a redstone signal, it will extract any items from that inventory if available, then transport it along until it finds an available inventory to insert into. When it reaches a junction, it will loop through the directions (S-W-N-E) for the first valid crop/inventory to insert into first. If the junction is given a redstone signal, it will reverse the direction to search in.
Experience crops are fairly straightforward; they will not grow at all unless given experience orbs. Once grown, glass bottles can be used to collect the experience with a right-click. By doing this, there is a 50/50 chance the crop's growth will be reset.
Their photosynthetic process allows them to store up the sun's energy as actual stored energy. A harvest of a fully grown crop will yield beans more powerful than potatoes.
This crop is so hardy, it hardly grows at all. One must mine this hard crop a few times to get it to grow. Once it is grown, it will start to mine out the chunk it is in, starting at the level it is planted on. If there is no chest above it to collect the mined blocks, it will spawn one of the blocks above it and wait until it is air. This quarry crop requires wheat crops to be planted around it, so it can then steal their attempts to grow in order to do its mining.
