The metastable crops exist in a state where delicate harvesting is needed to handle them. Bring shears, lest you yield nothing when the whole crops break. They need to be surrounded by each other in order to grow.
These crops suck, but that doesn't mean they are useless. By setting up a mirror that faces a farmland plot, one can plant/harvest vampire crops by clicking on the mirror. They will only reveal themselves through the mirror's reflection, and will only grow during a new moon.
They are crops with a magnetic personality. In fact, they are so magnetic, they can be attracted to one another. Growing two crops of opposing polarities at a distance more than one block apart will make them move towards each other. The farther apart they are, the more likely they will drop their item. One can use a blue or red dye to change their respective polarity.
