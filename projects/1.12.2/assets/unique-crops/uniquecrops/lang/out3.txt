Like the classic book written by T.H. White, this crop appears to move backwards through time, starting at appearing fully planted, and working backwards to the youngest stage. This only happens when they're given a special kind of bonemeal.
This crop takes a very long time to grow; quite literally a millennia! I'm not even sure what they'll drop. Growth accelerators from other mods are a must.
These crops will grow by dancing to the beat, note block songs, specifically. What kind of songs they'll like is completely up to you. Drops a random music disc.
These bright sparkers are quite precise! So precise, that there is only a small window where they can be successfully harvested to drop anything useful. Take cues from the growth visuals.
They're quite shy, but quite in need of your attentions. Weeping bells will only grow when you're looking directly at them. Once fully grown, do not take your eyes off of them, lest you face their wrath from your attentions being divided elsewhere.
They are quite possibly the most legal crops you can get. Of course, once you get past all the legal mumbo jumbo when planting every single one of them, that is.
Dye plants! Instead of planting the respective dye plants and harvesting said plant for dyes, it is all condensed in one crop, its appearance and respective drops depending on the time of day or night.
Hardy plants! They may look a little rocky, but they can prove to be quite useful in some circumstances. Once fully grown, you may have water on one side of the soil it is on and lava on the opposite side for free cobble being given out at random.
I must admit, I cheated a little in order to snag a picture of one actually planted. These crops, being just an abstract concept, will not materialize into the world as a form of "crops", instead taking its concept of growth from the planter as the planter plays throughout their time on the world.
