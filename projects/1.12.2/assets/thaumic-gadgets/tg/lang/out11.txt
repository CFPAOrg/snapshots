Experiments with the filing of the same essence on the lens did not lead to anything. Already in despair, you accidentally missed, submitting the opposite. And suddenly the effect of the lens has changed. Ignis lens and aer essence - Gives night vision and fire resistance, and also sets fire to the creatures who came close. Empty lense and aer essence - knockback creatures that you looks at. Perditio lens and ordo essence - imposes on creatures that the magician looks at "wither", "Slow 2" and "Weakness 2".

Seeker Amulet
A normal compass points to the north. Ender Eye - to the nearest portal in the End. And this amulet? Seeker Amulet... Where is he pulling you?
After some research, you find that the amulet only works in Nezer. And he points... To the lava lakes. Or that is hidden under them.
Dechantment Table
In your wanderings on the Nether, you accidentally found a strange building under the lava lake - some ancient vault. Inside is a strange sarcophagus, surrounded by statues of beings that you have never seen. But when you tried to open it... It was not easy, but you uncovered the sarcophagus. Inside the table was a concept... no, not an enchantment. Something ancient that you can not understand right away... You need to do some research...
Everything turned out to be much easier than you thought. This is the dechantment table. He destroys all enchantments imposed on the item. You just need to put the object on the table and wait a little... However, you still have not found a way to move or recreate this table. But you feel that this is still not all that can be done with it...
Enchantment Transfer
Watching the process of removing enchantment, you noticed that the residual magic of the object for some time is in the air. From what you have made the assumption that it can somehow be caught and used.
