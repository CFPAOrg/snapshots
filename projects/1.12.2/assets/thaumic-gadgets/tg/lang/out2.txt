A bag. It seems that everything is simple. But ordinary woven bags are heavy and inconsistent. This same magic bag has a fairly large volume, while, thanks to magic, almost nothing weighs. In addition, it "remembers" its owner, giving access to its contents only to him. The material of the bag will depend on its capacity: Magic bag - 18 slots, Enchanted bag - 27 slots, Bewitched bag - 36 slots.
