Experimenting with stones a little more, you invented another type of cut - oval. <BR>Stone and essence are also used to fill them: Quartz - 75 units, Amber - 60 units, Lapis - 50 units, Diamond - 40 units and Emerald - 35 units. These stones can be reused. After use, they will need time to recover. <BR>The effects of this cut are different from the sharp: Perditio - Increases the level of infection of the aura by 50 units; Ordo - Restores 5 health; Terra - Adds "10 golden hearts" for 5 min; Aqua - Creates a block of pure water; Ignis - Lights the fire on the block; Aer - Gives scuba breathing for 3 minutes. And don't forgot about prev. sharp cut. <BR> Effects of stones: Perditio - Gives a "death look" for 3 minutes; Ordo - Removes negative effects; Terra - Gives "Resistance Damage"; Aqua - Freezes water into ice and turns lava into obsidian in a 5x5x5 area; Ignis - gives "Fire Resistance" for 5 minutes; Aer - Gives "Speed ​​2" and "Jumping 2" for 3 minutes. <PAGE><IMG>tg:textures/gui/research/recipe_cutting_table.png:0:0:195:149:1</IMG>
Lenses
Once, turning the thaumometer in your hands, you caught yourself thinking that it would be nice to reduce it and insert it in glasses instead of glasses or... Or as an additional lens. What if you try to fill the glass with aspects like you did with stones?
The result was curious. Ordinary glass is not suitable for filling aspects. You had to create a special lens capable of absorbing the essence, while being quite miniature. Filling an empty lens with the original aspects in a gemcutter table gives it certain permanent effects: Aqua provides the ability to look through the water as if it were not there. Ignis allows you to see the night as well as during the day, but unfortunately it does not work in the water. Perditio will give your eyesight the effect of "death gaze." And despite such a success, you understand that this is not the limit of possibilities ...
