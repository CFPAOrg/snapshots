Metal of Light
Light... When you studied the sun, you began to think: "What would have happened if the wind was hard? What would be its properties?". To discard this stupid idea completely, you decided to prove to yourself that this is impossible...
But the effect was reversed. You were able to create a light metal ore, filling the Golden Ore with the Essence Lux, Aurum and Permutatio. But the resulting ore is too refractory, even for Hell's furnace. The only solution is Blast furnace. The resulting metal emits a soft, pleasant light, but because of its extreme refractoriness, nothing can be done from it... Just like that. To create tools from light metal, you need a matrix. Sensitive to the time of day, these tools are self-refreshed during the day and seem to help you in your work, however at night...
Further studies of light metal led you to the idea that it would be possible to create a good armor from it. Changing the battle armor with the help of light metal, you got Light armor - a very serious defense. In the afternoon, it also has the property of self-repair. But it seems to you that its potential is not fully disclosed...
Primal Armor
Meeting with the ancient creatures from Eldritch chut did not end for you to ruin, but you were lucky ... This time. It's time to think about a way to protect yourself from such creatures.
Primal armor. That says it all. Having filled the Battle thaum-armor with the primal aspects, light, shadow and hollow metals, and the energy of the singular pearl, you created a monolithic armor that was not subject to destruction. But that's why you can not impose any charms on it. However, the armor will always be enchanted by "Protection 5", and the boots also on "Speed5" and the possible "Traveller's Boots". In addition, the energy of the original pearl gave the armor the strength of the original aspects of Aer, Ignis, Aqua, Terra, Ordo and Perditio.
