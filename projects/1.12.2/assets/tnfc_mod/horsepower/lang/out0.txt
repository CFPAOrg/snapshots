The grindstone will grind down items to their base components. When setting up a grindstone make sure you have a 7x7 and 2 blocks high area cleared before starting, there needs to be solid ground under the 7x7 area.
In the middle of the 7x7 place a block of your choice and then place the grindstone above that. If the area isn't cleared to grindstone will say that when looking at it. Next, use a lead to get a Horse/Donkey/Mule/Llama of your choice to be working the grinder.
With the animal attached with the lead right click the grindstone and the animal should now be connected to that. Now simply right click the grindstone with a item that can be grinded to start the process or attach any automatic input/output on the top or bottom.
