The screwdriver is the main tool in the configuration of lamps. Right-click on the lamp to open the setup interface.
The two-tone lamp works like a regular lamp, but has the ability to change its color. By default, when a strong signal is green, with a low signal colour red.
The mini lamp has the same principle but it is smaller.
Level lamp has advanced functionality. Depending on the signal level, the lamp changes its color from red to green. The lamp has two types: Lamp, Battery. Also, the received signal can be inverted.
Disco lamp, like the level lamp, changes its color, only for each signal level, you can set the color. The received signal cannot be inverted in the disco lamp.
