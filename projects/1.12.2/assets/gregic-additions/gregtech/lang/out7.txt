The Coke Oven is a 3x3 multiblock structure used for turning Coal into Coal Coke, Lignite into Lignite Coke and Logs into Charcoal, with Creosote Oil as a byproduct.
The Assembly Line is a large multiblock structure consisting of 5 to 16 "slices". In theory, it's large Assembling Machine, used for creating advanced crafting components.
The Fusion Reactor Mark 1 is a large multiblock structure used for fusing elements into heavier ones. The Mark 1 Fusion Reactor can use LuV, ZPM or UV Energy Hatches. For every Hatch it has its buffer increases by 100k.
The Fusion Reactor Mark 2 is a large multiblock structure used for fusing elements into heavier ones. The Mark 2 Fusion Reactor can use ZPM or UV Energy Hatches. For every Hatch it has its buffer increases by 200k.
The Fusion Reactor Mark 3 is a large multiblock structure used for fusing elements into heavier ones. The Mark 3 Fusion Reactor can only use UV Energy Hatches. For every Hatch it has its buffer increases by 400k.
