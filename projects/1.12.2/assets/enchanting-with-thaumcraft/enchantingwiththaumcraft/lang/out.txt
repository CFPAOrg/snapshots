Aquatic Armor Enchantments
I've decided to dedicate the water-based enchantments to their own section, as they are all probably related to materials of similar origin. Looks like I'll need to fish up some volunteers for my research.
Further examination of these fish have revealed some interesting properties. Clownfish seem to be particularly intelligent, which makes them perfect for Aqua Affinity. Pufferfish are able to hold the largest amount of air, linking them to Respiration. Lastly, Salmon are able to attain the highest speeds, making them the choice for Depth Strider. Unfortunately, cod did not turn out to have any exceptional properties, though I admit they do make for a tasty meal.
Fishing Rod Enchantments
Sometimes a thaumaturge just wants to relax, and what better activity than fishing? However, as relaxing as it may be, I can't help but feel I could be relaxing more efficiently. On that thought, I've begun my research into the fishing rod enchantments, namely Lure and Luck of The Sea. Both could be related to a gem of some sort, but that is likely too complicated for a simple fishing enchantment. For Lure, I shall simply look into seeds, and for Luck of The Sea, gold nuggets.
Lure was indeed related to seeds, though the higher levels will require increasing varieties. Luck of The Sea was also related to gold, but it requires ingots rather than nuggets. The recreation of these enchantments should greatly increase the efficiency of my relaxation.
