Enchanting
Enchanted Books
While enchanting tables are useful in their own right, the process is seemingly random, and it has become quite the chore to enchant masses of items just to find one particular enchantment. There must be a more efficient way to do this. The types of enchantments normally available tend to change depending on the tool inserted, but the enchanting table lacks any way to incorporate further materials. Perhaps infusion is the key?
My theory turned out to be correct, although it has a few fundamental differences from traditional enchanting. The most obvious is that it incorporates more materials related to the enchantment itself, which thankfully has the side effect of removing the need for experience. This process revolves around two specific items: books and amber. Out of all enchantable materials, books have proven to be the best, able to take on any enchantment desired. Amber is also important, acting as a translator of sorts, allowing even mundane materials to play a role in the choice of enchantment. To this end, I've recreated the most basic enchantments.
Tool Enchantments
The only tool enchantments I've yet to recreate are Silk Touch and Fortune. Fortune is likely related to some sort of gem, but Silk Touch is a bit trickier. Maybe those rare earths I've come across are related somehow?
Success! Fortune and Silk Touch will make for excellent additions to my repertoire. Fortune can be created with Emerald, and Silk Touch requires rare earths, as I suspected, as well as a couple of slime balls, strangely enough.
Basic Weapon Enchantments
To begin my research into weapon enchantments, I've decided to look into Sharpness and Knockback. I see only one good candidate for Sharpness: quartz. And for Knockback, as silly as it may seem, pistons could be the answer.
My hunches were right, though with one caveat. The higher levels of Sharpness also involve diamonds, in addition to quartz. Knockback can be created as expected, with pistons.
