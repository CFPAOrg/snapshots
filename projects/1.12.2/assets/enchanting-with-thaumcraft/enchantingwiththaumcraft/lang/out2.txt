Not only were my guesses correct, but these ingredients appear to be the only two items related to the enchantments. Power can be created with increasing amounts of quicksilver; Punch is likewise with ender pearls.
Advanced Bow Enchantments
I believe the Flame enchantment can be easily recreated with the help of alumentum, given its nature as a long-lasting fuel. However, infinity is quite a strange enchantment, seemingly defying the natural laws of the world. Regardless, I believe ender eyes might be connected, seeing as when they are released into the air they are drawn towards some foreign source of energy.
Success! The Flame enchantment was indeed related to alumentum, though the final recipe requires a couple extra clumps of blaze powder. Infinity can also be recreated with ender eyes, though it requires more than I expected.
Basic Armor Enchantments
Now that I've figured out how Protection works, the remaining protection-based enchantments shouldn't be too much of a problem. I believe I have the keys to recreating these enchantments, though the higher levels may require more powerful ingredients.
Blast Protection is created with slime balls, but the higher levels require the most blast-resistant material I could find: obsidian. As for Projectile Protection, it is created with enchanted fabric and supplemented with slime blocks for the more powerful versions. Lastly, Fire Protection requires the use of magma cream, which is strangely cool to the touch, as well as ice for the higher levels, although it may be a problem getting a chunk of ice onto a pedestal.
Advanced Armor Enchantments
To finish up my collection of the standard armor enchantments, all that's needed is Thorns and Feather Falling. Thankfully, both of these enchantments seem to be obviously related to common materials.
As I thought, Thorns can be created with the use of cactus and Feather Falling with, well, feathers. What's more is that no additional ingredients are required.
