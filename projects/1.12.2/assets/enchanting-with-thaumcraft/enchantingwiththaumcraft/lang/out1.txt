Specialized Weapon Enchantments
Sharpness works for most purposes, but sometimes I'd prefer a more specialized enchantment, namely Smite or Bane of Arthropods. I wonder if Smite is related to glistering melons, parallel to the potion? Bane of Arthropods is likely unresponsive to normal spider eyes, but fermentation may change the story.
Looks like I was right, the process of fermentation on spider eyes seems to make them quite potent against their former owners. As for Smite, the lower levels can indeed be created with glistering melons, although the higher levels require an additional ingredient: silverwood saplings. Perhaps there is some truth to the "silver" in silverwood.
Advanced Weapon Enchantments
The rare weapon enchantments, Fire Aspect, Looting, and Sweeping Edge, are all fairly simple concepts, but that also means a lot of potential candidates. Thankfully, the nature of alumentum means it should work as a catch-all material for Fire Aspect. As for Looting, gold seems to be the logical starting point. And for Sweeping Edge, I would prefer to use raw lightning but the destructive properties of TNT shall have to suffice.
It turns out that gold was the key, but a lot more of it is involved in Looting than I expected. The alumentum also worked, although I had to supplement it with blaze rods to finalize the process. As for Sweeping Edge, it seems the TNT was a bit overkill and the lower levels can be created with gunpowder alone.
Basic Bow Enchantments
For bow enchantments, I shall begin with Power and Punch. Ender pearls are likely involved in Punch, as they are easily thrown and do cause movement, albeit strangely. My initial thoughts regarding Power turned towards gems of some sort, but I believe I will need a less rigid substance. I've yet to find many uses for quicksilver, perhaps it has some hidden properties?
