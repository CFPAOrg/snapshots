A challenge and then an idea and ended up being the tiniest horror a player will see, based on ideas and inspirations of JamesWhiteShirt and DarkCow this mob will spawn as 1/1000 from breaking a log (any, modded or vanilla) and only if broken by the player (so do not worry about your tree farms) and will attack quickly and once 1.5 hearts or less will try to ride on the player's face and attack him. Once ridding on the player, it can only be killed by jumping as each jump has a 80%% chance to hit the mob (will need a max of 3 successful jumps to kill it).
