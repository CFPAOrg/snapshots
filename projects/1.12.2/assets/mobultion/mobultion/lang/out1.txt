An enderpearl that is almost twice as fast but greatly less accurate and will cause 3 hearts of damage instead of 2.5.
An enderpearl that is 20% slower but greatly more accurate and will cause no damage.
An enderpearl that is 10% faster with a little bit better accuracy, causes normal enderpearl damage and has a 50% (configurable) chance to break instead of teleporting. Will cause thorns damage to the hit entity on impact.
A proof of power over the vampires that can be crushed to one single bonemeal (why would you do that). Can be crafted with three strings to make a Fang necklace.

A tool with no current usefulness right now.
Congrats, you are looking at the most useless item yet it took a full day to model. Good job me. However due to a lot of time on hand this hat can be brewed to a jokerness potion.
A wand that can only be used by the shamans, since you are not a shaman you can use it for up to 6 times to heal 2 hearts with a cool down of course.
A health pack directly from that first aid kit that expired 20 years ago. However you can still use it to heal 2 hearts up to 3 times with cool down of course.
An arrow with barely any damage that will affect the hit entity with Jokerness effect.
A shard that dropped with the angel spider directly from heaven that can heal corruption and give one golden heart upon eating it.
