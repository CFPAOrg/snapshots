A sharp shooter with zero inaccuracy, making him the hardest to dodge. can be found lurking and hiding under tress in the forests using his cover made of leaves. Will poison upon hit. Upon death has a chance to drop his forest bow which is not that different from the normal bow because the power is in the shooter not the bow.
This is just a wither skeleton with a bow instead but I always thought it was strange that there is no wither skeletons with a bow. He is also quite shorter than the wither skeleton to save on models and RAM.
A Vampire skeleton, based on the idea of Upcraft, that heals from drinking the player's blood but instantly dies from sun light. Can only be killed with sweeping edge sword or fire aspect sword. Can also be damaged by fire stuff like lava, fire and fire balls. Will morph into a bat if in really low health (under 2 hearts) which means that it will not drop its loot if the player did not kill it fast enough.
After being kicked from med school for trying to eat the brains in anatomy class, this zombie did not give up and started roaming everywhere (literally) to heal those injured (just zombies) and extinguish those who are burning (just zombies).
This zombie might have run from another game (MK for those who do not know the reference) and wielded 4 swords in his hands making him the strongest with 25 hearts but luckily he spawns on extreme mountains (unless configured to spawn somewhere else) making him an unlikely encounter.
This noble knight lost his job when he slept on his night shift and the king ended up being killed so he roams trying to retrieve his dignity. Has a really high chance to spawn with iron armor.
A lava fused zombie wielding a powerful fire sword that burns the enemies. The sword can drop but the sword is cursed and does not like when the sword is too much damaged and will try to burn the player upon holding (only if too damaged). The sword can be repaired with diamonds but is not craft-able (configurable).
