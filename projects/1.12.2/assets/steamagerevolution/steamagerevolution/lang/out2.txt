Boiler
The hissing heart of any Steampunk's factory. Squat and brassy, this multiblock is to be fed fuel through fireboxes placed in the bottom, and water through the sides. Steam is then output from either the sides or top of the boiler. Warning! Don't let the boiler sit idle without anywhere to output its steam else pressure will begin to build up. That may have explosive results. Pressure monitors allow you to detect this by emitting a redstone signal of strength relative to pressure and valves will release pressure when given a redstone signal. The use of valves is wasteful since it allows steam to escape.
Crucible
§oBy fire!§r The crucible is a multiblock used to melt metals of all shapes so that it may more easily feed other machines. Built mainly of copper to ensure heat is conducted efficiently and fed by steam from boilers. Unlike other smeltery designs you may be familiar with, the crucible is enclosed on all six sides. Item and steam inputs, and fluid outputs, may be placed anywhere in the crucible's structure except in the outer frame. Should one wish to allow the molten metal to cool for further processing and shaping, the Casting Block will take 1296mB of molten metal and allow it to cool into a solid block.
Alloy Forge
The alloy forge is a much more efficient way of alloying metals than manually mixing the appropriate dusts and then smelting. It must contain lava, flowing or otherwise, completely filling its interior. Taking a base of molten copper and adding molten zinc will result in molten brass.
Steelworks
While brass is an extremely versatile material, some applications require more strength. Constructing a machine from heat-resistant materials found in the Nether allows you to safely attain the high temperatures required for the production of steel. Given a working pool of molten iron equivalent to nine blocks (11664mB) and provided with carbon and injected steam, molten steel will be output at a rate of one nugget per operation.
