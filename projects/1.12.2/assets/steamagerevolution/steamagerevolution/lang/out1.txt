Getting started
The hammer
§lRockbreaker!§r The hammer is used to break down materials into their constituent parts. In other words, smashing things to bits. Particularly useful for pulverising ores into dusts that can then be combined to allow creation of alloys. Soon, you will be able to build a machine that automates this repetitive rock breaking. The hammer is also useful in shaping metals for use in machines - hammering ingots will create plates.
New ores
Several new materials will be used in the creation of the machines to come. Copper can be found in the upper layers of the world, while Zinc is to be found slightly lower. Both materials are fairly abundant. They may be directly smelted into ingots, or the hammer can break them into dust.
Brass creation
§oDown to brass tacks.§r Combining copper and zinc gives an important new material - brass. Brass is strong while also being easy to machine. It is also quite conductive and ductile. A jack of all trades, master of none kind of alloy if you will. Initially, brass can be created by mixing copper and zinc powder to give brass powder that is then smelted into brass ingots. 
Industrialization
Proper Machines
Many processes are too complex to take place within the confines of a single block space. Thus you must create multiblocks by placing a series of machine blocks in the world, in a particular shape. This is often rectangular. You can shift-right-click on any multiblock part and it will tell you the multiblock's status.
