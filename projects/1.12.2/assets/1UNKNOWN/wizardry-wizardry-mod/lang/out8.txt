Capes may be glorious and powerful, but they are fickle. They will easily give up their loyalty to another, because one wizard is the same as another to them. If you can cheat a master out of their cape, it's the same as if you'd worn it for years yourself.<br>So if you do happen to find a beautiful, billowing cape on another's rapidly-cooling body, there's no harm in peeling it off and trying it on. And really, does it matter how they died? A cape is a cape.
Step 3: Nacre
Learn about pearls and their magical properties
Nacre, the liquid that pearls are formed from - known as mother-of-pearl - is a very thick, pale, and iridescent liquid that is able to channel mana quite flawlessly.<br>To get this liquid, simply throw a gold nugget into liquid mana, and they'll mix together into the resplendent stuff.<br>Now, as for why you want this: with it you can create "nacre pearls", which can be infused with spells to cast them.
To make a nacre pearl, take a glass orb and throw it in the milky liquid. There are six levels of nacre pearl quality. Wasted is the worst, then drained, flawed, decent, potent, and finally, Apex. You ideally want Apex Pearls, but that takes careful effort to make. The worse the quality of the pearl, the weaker the spell and the more mana it consumes. To get the highest pearl quality, you must keep the glass orb in the nacre for &oexactly&r 30 seconds. Any more reduces quality, but any less does too. This isn't required, of course. Apex pearls are good, but  you will do fine with potent and decent quality pearls.<br>You will be using these pearls later on in spell infusion.
Step 4: Structures
Learn about the structure you will need to build
You've got your mana, you've got your crooked halo, you've got your beautiful cape, and you've got your shimmering nacre pearls. But how do you actually infuse a spell into a pearl? Well, we just need one last device before we get there.
