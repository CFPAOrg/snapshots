It is one final point of interest that spiritwights reserve their hatred for wizards. As far as we know, they show no interest in any other creature. A unicorn may go where a wizard fears to tread, and face no danger. There must be some reason for this, but who knows it.
Unicorns
Getting kicked back to Overworld has never been easier
Please, make no mistake; these are not the gentle, damsel-loving creatures of song and story. The tales I heard as a child about unicorns were keen to stress their beauty and intelligence, their kindness and faithfulness. Real unicorns are better described as 'stroppy'.
These underworld-native creatures are savage and territorial, sharp of horn and hard of hoof. As far as we can tell, they possess a burning desire to kick, stab or otherwise maim any animal that crosses their path - wizards included - and will even resort to biting if in the mood. They seem to harbor a particular grudge against fairies, which they eat when possible.
Some have argued that unicorns have little practical value, but their horns have potent magical properties. Also - as I've said elsewhere - fairies are remarkably annoying, so anything that keeps their numbers down can't be all bad.

Life is rare among the cloudy skies of the Underworld (it is the realm of the dead, after all), but there are a few beings<br><WIP>
To get to the underworld, jump from a height over 130 blocks and smack bedrock, you will fall straight through into the top of the underworld where you will be greeted with a pleasant and relatively safe fall to itâ€™s clouds.
To get back from the underworld, fall into its void. You will fall straight into the top of the overworld.
