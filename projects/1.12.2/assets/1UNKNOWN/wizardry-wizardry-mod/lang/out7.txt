Now of course, we want to get this liquid into our bodies to use it. To get mana inside of you, craft a syringe and craft that syringe with a mana orb or hold down the syringe pointing at some mana liquid in the world. You now have a mana syringe that you can inject straight into your bloodstream.
Just like anything else, too much mana is a bad thing.. Drinking too much water can pose a threat to your health. Doing the same with mana is several magnitudes more dangerous. The body can only store a certain amount before it starts to manifest side effects known as "mana burn".<br>Imagine you took all of the world's animal life, gave them all pure caffeine, compressed them into a single squirrel, and then made that squirrel a wizard.<br>That's what having mana burn is like.
Finally, you can store the mana liquid into orbs. Simply craft glass orbs and throw them a block of liquid mana, it will instantly fill up. You now have portable mana that you will need later. Do stock up on this stuff, you'll need a lot of it.

Once you've injected mana, you might be wondering why you don't have a bar showing you how much you have. Well although the mana is flowing in your blood stream right now, you simply cannot channel it yet.<br>Angels are bits of divinity. Their Grace allows them to have a constant supply of mana... but you don't have it that easy. You'll have to make do with what's called a crude halo, instead of the glorious one of an angel.<br> Once you equip the crude halo, you will be able to see your mana bar.
Next up is the cape. Capes are not storages, but they are conduits, aiding wizards in mana transference and reducing mana loss. Once you craft yourself a cape, wear it and do not take it off. The cape will get stronger the longer you wear it. At first, it barely reduces spell cost, but after you wear it for prolonged periods of time, it can reduce mana spell cost down to a quarter of what it was.
