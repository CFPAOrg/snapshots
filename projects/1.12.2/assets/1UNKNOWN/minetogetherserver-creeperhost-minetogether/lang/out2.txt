Welcome new player!
Our name is CreeperHost, and we created MineTogether to fill in some of the community features we felt modded Minecraft was missing.
In doing so, we require a way to identify you to make sure we send you all the right information, like who is in your friends list etc.
We do this by taking the unique identifier for your Minecraft account (UUID), then running it through the same kind of cryptography (hashing) that most websites use to keep your password secure and cannot be reversed.
