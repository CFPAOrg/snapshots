Maximum Recursion
Stencil Value
Render Distance (Chunks)
Max Renders Per Frame
Maximum recursion for World Portals. Set to 0 to disable World Portal render.\n\nWarning! The higher this is, the more recursion, the more FPS loss!
Stencils use a specific value to see if the render is ours or not. \n\nIf you're having rendering issues and changing this doesn't help, there might be a conflicting mod. Find out which mod that is and inform both that mod's author and me (iChun).
Sets the render distance of each world portal (by chunk) if it's not overridden by the world portal.\n\nSetting to 0 binds to MC's default game settings.
Max World Portal Renders per frame.\nThis will limit the number of renders a tick despite your maxRecursion setting.\nThis is here in hopes that your FPS doesn't tank if you happen to be at the wrong place in the wrong place.
