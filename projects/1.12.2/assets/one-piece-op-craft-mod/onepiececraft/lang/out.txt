Geppo (or Moon Walk) allows the users to jump off the air itself, allowing them to stay in the air for much longer than usual. It can be trained by jumping while not moving.
Tekkai (or Iron Body) hardens the users' muscles to the level of iron, in order to nullify damage taken from attacks. Higher levels provide longer protection. It can be trained by getting hit from iron items or by a falling anvil.
Shigan (or Finger Pistol) is a close-quarter combat technique, in which the users push their finger into a certain target at a very high speed, leaving a wound similar to a bullet wound. It can be trained by punching other entities.
Rankyaku (or Storm Leg) is a powerful projectile technique, in which the users start by kicking at very high speeds and strength, sending out a sharp compressed air blade that can greatly damage a human body. It can be trained by jumping while running.
Soru (or Shave) allows the users to move at extremely high speeds in order to avoid attacks, as well as to attack at higher speeds and with greater power. It was revealed that the principle of this move was to kick off the ground at least ten times in the blink of an eye. It can be trained by running in plain surfaces.
Kami-e (or Paper Drawing) makes the users' body extraordinarily flexible in order to avoid any attacks. It can be trained by running in sugarcanes or tall plants.
Rokuogan (or Six King Gun) is the secret and ultimate attack of the Rokushiri style. It creates a shock wave in a forward direction that causes massive internal injuries.
