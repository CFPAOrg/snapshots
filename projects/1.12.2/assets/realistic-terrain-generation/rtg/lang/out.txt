RTG Tree Settings
RTG Trees From Saplings
Set this to TRUE to allow RTG's custom trees to grow from vanilla saplings.\nRTG's custom trees can be grown only from the saplings that their leaves would drop, and only in the biomes where they naturally generate.
RTG Tree Chance
A 1/x chance that a vanilla sapling will grow an RTG custom tree.
Tree Density Multiplier
This setting allows you to increase/decrease the number of RTG trees that generate globally.\nThis setting only affects trees generated by RTG. Trees generated by a biome's decorator will adhere to their own density rules. You can override this setting on a per-biome basis by using the biome configs.
Trees Can Generate On Sand
Set this to FALSE to prevent trees from generating on sand.\nThis setting only affects trees generated by RTG. Trees generated by a biome's decorator will adhere to their own generation rules. (RTG's Palm Trees ignore this setting.)
Shrubs Below Surface
Set this to FALSE to prevent shrub trunks from generating below the surface.
Bark Covered Logs
Set this to FALSE to prevent the trunks of RTG trees from using the 'all-bark' texture model.\nFor more information, visit http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wood#Block_data
