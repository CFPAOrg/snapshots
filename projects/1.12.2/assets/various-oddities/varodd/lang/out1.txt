Spawns the contained entity
Spawns the contained entity with the applied inscriptions
A durable shield against unavoidable projectiles
A potent munition imbued with lethal magic
A high-quality ink used mostly for decorative pursuits.
They seem to grip against the nearest wall
As swift as a summer's breeze
The sound of a windy day echoes within
You can hear an ocean...
A valuable commodity and a useful gambling tool
A direct connection to your most valuable possession.
Vaporises a vast quantity of water... once.
A whiff of fleeting stealth
That which is hidden shall be unhidden
This must have some use...
Freezes targets in place, but gets a little tired...
An endless supply of watery gruel
A shiny bauble of considerable wealth
A convenient searching tool
No more worry for high shelves
Sneak whilst looking at items and objects to control
It gives off a menacing aura...
A friend and boy
A submariner's most valued possession
Emits a damaging and deafening noise when blown
Failure chance: %s
A bolt from the blue sky!
A directional light source
A light that glimpses even the unseen
Its warmth is soothing and protective
A resilient field surrounds them
Performs minor repairs on-the-go
Walk like the Men of Ender
It stores the energy of damaging falls, though you know not where...
Keeps you from starving, but not much else
Become unseen
