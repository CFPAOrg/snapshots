A modest skip in your step
Behold, Springheel Steve!
A magical tool for resisting constraints of motion
Your hand tingles with youthful endurance
It pulses in rhythm with your heart
Imbued with mild protective magics
Look ma, no flippers!
As graceful as a salmon
No ice required!
Not even the gods could shift it, but the lightest touch might
A convenient bag for the carrying of things
The alchemist's vital tool, when in a hurry
It's durable properties might be exploitable...
It's durable properties might be exploitable...
It burrows and bites at all things that have been made to move
It busily munches on magical auras afflicting the wearer.
Try not to overfeed it!
Keeps unwanted pests at bay
Hmm, needs a few shakes
It needs to be properly stewed
Restores motion to the motionless
A layman's tool for repelling vulnerable undead
A makeshift device that repels vulnerable undead
A scholar's sigil, which undead cannot tolerate
The mark of a noble priest, standing against the undead
A powerful emblem to repel the mightiest of undead
A convenient tool for measuring time
The discarded shell of a strange nomad...
It always pays to keep track of things
The wisdom of a lost soul...
It sizzles even against the air
It's scalding to the touch
A blessed tonic, anathema to the evil and undead
An effective, if unpalatable, curative against mundane poisons
It writhes against the glass, trying to constrict all it touches
A single loud bang and then...
