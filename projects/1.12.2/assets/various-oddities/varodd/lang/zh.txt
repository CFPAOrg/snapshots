A durable shield against unavoidable projectiles

A shiny bauble of considerable wealth
A convenient searching tool
No more worry for high shelves

A bolt from the blue sky!
A directional light source
A light that glimpses even the unseen
Its warmth is soothing and protective
A resilient field surrounds them
Performs minor repairs on-the-go
Walk like the Men of Ender
It stores the energy of damaging falls, though you know not where...
Keeps you from starving, but not much else
Become unseen
A modest skip in your step
Behold, Springheel Steve!
A magical tool for resisting constraints of motion
Your hand tingles with youthful endurance

A convenient bag for the carrying of things
The alchemist's vital tool, when in a hurry
It's durable properties might be exploitable...

It burrows and bites at all things that have been made to move
It busily munches on magical auras afflicting the wearer.
Try not to overfeed it!
Keeps unwanted pests at bay
Hmm, needs a few shakes
It needs to be properly stewed
Restores motion to the motionless
A layman's tool for repelling vulnerable undead
A makeshift device that repels vulnerable undead
A scholar's sigil, which undead cannot tolerate
The mark of a noble priest, standing against the undead
A powerful emblem to repel the mightiest of undead
A convenient tool for measuring time
The discarded shell of a strange nomad...
It always pays to keep track of things
The wisdom of a lost soul...
It sizzles even against the air
It's scalding to the touch
A blessed tonic, anathema to the evil and undead
An effective, if unpalatable, curative against mundane poisons
It writhes against the glass, trying to constrict all it touches
A single loud bang and then...
