Disable if this is a simple server with a single world (no lobbies, game mode worlds etc). Multiworld detection can only cause issues on such servers. Installing the mod on server side should prevent the issues though.

Add Sub-World Connection
Delete Sub-World Connection
Connect/disconnect selected sub-world to/from the current "auto" one. Only connect sub-worlds that are from the same world save. For example, if a vanilla Nether portal takes you from sub-world A to sub-world B, then you can connect them. Sub-worlds connected to your current one are always at the top of the list and are marked by a * symbol.
Would you like to create the following connection between sub-worlds?
Would you like to delete the following connection between sub-worlds?
You are trying to teleport to a sub-world which isn't connected to the current "auto" one. If you are sure that this sub-world is from the same sub-server/world save, then you can enable teleportation by adding a connection in the waypoints menu -> Options -> Add Sub-World Connection. However, if you connect unrelated sub-worlds and teleport, then you might suffocate in a block or die from fall damage, so don't do that.
Ignore Server Heightmaps
Some servers put custom values in the world heightmaps, which can cause incorrectly rendered maps. Sometimes it can even happen in heavily modded singleplayer worlds. This option should fix such issues at the expense of a bit of performance. Do not use unless you need to. Reenter the world after toggling the option!
