Speed Upgrade
Used in the Turret Assembly Table
This optimizes the assembly process and makes the assembly table 4x faster. Since this optimization isn't free to come by, it'll increase the energy consumption of the current crafting operation by 10%% (after the 4x increase of RF/t).
Filter Upgrade
Used in the Turret Assembly Table
This will filter what's going into the assembly table.\nAfter right-clicking you can configure the filter. In empty slots can go anything. In configured slots can only go the item configured (obviously), but those items won't go anywhere else, not even in empty configured slots.\nShift-right-click clears the filter.\n\nThe filter operates not only on the user-side of things (putting stuff into the table via GUI) but also with external insertion devices like the hopper.\n\nPlease note that you can't configure the stack size of items, thus it will always try to put a whole stack (depends on how many items can be stacked together) in a slot.\n\nf you want to put in more than 1 stack into the table, you can configure 2 or more slots with the same item.
