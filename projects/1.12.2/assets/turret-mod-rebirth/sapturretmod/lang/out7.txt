Fuel Tank
Used by the Flamethrower Turret. Flames have, like lasers, no knockback effect and are ineffective against fire-resistant targets (unless upgraded). They deal a hefty amount of damage and sets targets on fire for 5 seconds.\nLike the minigun cartridges, a tank provides 16 shots, due to the rapid firing rate of the turret.\n\nCan be packaged, whose items will provide 16x ammo.
