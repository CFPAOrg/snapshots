Socket Api Tokens for Streamlabs. One token per line. Most likely requires a Streamlabs widget to be open when running. I would recommend the event list widget. To find your socket API token: Go to Streamlabs -> Dashboard -> Settings (in left sidebar) -> API Settings -> API Tokens -> Your Socket API Token
JWT Tokens for StreamElements. One token per line. To find your JWT token: Go to StreamElements -> Dashboard -> Click on your profile name (top right) -> Show secrets
Tokens for DonationAlerts. One token per line. Untested. Please let me know if it works!
Twitch channels' chat to listen to. One channel per line.

Maximum amount of automatic reconnects before trying giving up.
The sockets we use can be unreliable at times. Turn this on to get toasts about their status and other events.
URLs to pull online configs from. These should link to a raw file of the configuration. These configs will override local configs.
Enable local statistics collection? This information is for your own personal reference. None of it will be sent externally.
Allow outcomes that require a server to wait until the user connects to a server that allows them to send outcomes? Outcomes are normally discarded otherwise.
