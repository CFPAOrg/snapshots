CCI Debug Mode turned on.
Debug Mode allows CCI to read past Streamlabs/StreamElements events in a "test.log" file. Copy out their event lines from the logs and put it in a "test.log" file in your profile folder (where all the json files are). Hit Shift+Tab to cycle through the lines of test.log. You should have your console open to see the outputs.
