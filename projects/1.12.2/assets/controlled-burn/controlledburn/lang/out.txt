Spread Strength (Natural Spread)
When fire spreads naturally, ie. not when it's spreading by destroying (burning) a block, the new fire's duration is set to the duration of the fire it came from, multiplied by this\n\nFire's lifetime is only measured in integers from 0 to 15, so if you set the percentage to anything lower than 7 it will be the same as if you set it to 0\n\nUses a full-number percentage (25 means 25% strength, 75 means 75% strength)\n\nThe normal vanilla fire mechanics don't use a percentage reduction like this, so set this to -1 if you want vanilla mechanics in this regard\n \n
