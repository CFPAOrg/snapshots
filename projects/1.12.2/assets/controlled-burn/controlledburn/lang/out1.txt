If set to true, fire ignores the fire resistance of humid biomes\n\nThis affects block destruction (burn) chance and natural fire spread chance in humid biomes\n \n
Ignore Rain
If set to true, fire ignores rain\n\nWHEN IT'S RAINING this affects chance of fire extinguishing from rain, chance of natural fire spread, and chance of fire spread when fire destroys (burns) a block\n \n
Disable Fires From Lava
Whether fire spreading from lava is disabled\n \n
Disable Fires From Lightning
Whether fire spreading from lightning is disabled\n \n
LOS-Only Fire Spread
Whether fire requires line-of-sight to spread to a new location\n \n
Max Burn Spread Chance
When a fire at the MAXIMUM age (15 in vanilla) destroys (burns through) a block, the chance that the broken (burnt) block is replaced with fire\n\nDoes nothing if fire never destroys blocks, eg. if dontDestroyBlocks is set to true\n\nUses a full-number percentage (25 means 25% chance, 75 means 75% chance)\n \n
Min Burn Spread Chance
When a fire at the MINIMUM age (0 in vanilla) destroys (burns through) a block, the chance that the broken (burnt) block is replaced with fire\n\nDoes nothing if fire never destroys blocks, eg. if dontDestroyBlocks is set to true\n\nUses a full-number percentage (25 means 25% chance, 75 means 75% chance)\n \n
Reach (Upwards)
The maximum upward distance fire can naturally spread to when updating (eg. between two trees)\n \n
Reach (Downwards)
The maximum downward distance fire can naturally spread to when updating (eg. between two trees)\n \n
Reach (Sideways)
The maximum horizontal distance fire can naturally spread to when updating (eg. between two trees)\n \n
Spread Strength (Block Destroyed)
When fire spreads by destroying a block, the new fire's duration is set to the duration of the fire it came from, multiplied by this\n\nFire's lifetime is only measured in integers from 0 to 15, so if you set the percentage to anything lower than 7 it will be the same as if you set it to 0\n\nUses a full-number percentage (25 means 25% strength, 75 means 75% strength)\n\nThe normal vanilla fire mechanics don't use a percentage reduction like this, so set this to -1 if you want vanilla mechanics in this regard\n \n
