Global Multipliers
Multipliers for how fast fire naturally spreads and how fast fire burns blocks\n\nAlso includes the setting for how often fire updates (which makes everything fire-related faster or slower)\n \n
Special Toggles
Includes whether certain sources can start fires, whether fire ignores rain, and other oddities\n \n
Burn Spread Chances
These determine how often fire spreads to adjacent blocks after burning a block\n \n
Fire Spread Ranges / Reach
How far fire can naturally spread from one block to another in each direction\n \n
Spread Strengths (Advanced)
How much "life" new fires have when spreading\n \n
Block-Specific Settings (Advanced)
Block Transformations
This allows you to set what a block will become when it burns\nEg. you can make grass blocks turn to dirt by using this setting:\nminecraft:grass, minecraft:dirt\n\nKeep in mind that this won't do anything unless you make sure the first block is actually flammable (and maybe give it encouragement too, depending; see the MC wiki for more info on those stats)\n \n
Burn Speed Multiplier
How fast blocks are destroyed (burnt) when 'on fire', as a multiplier (2 means twice as fast, 0.5 means half as fast)\n\nAKA flammability multiplier\n\nSet this to 0 to make it so fire doesn't break (burn) blocks at all (but can still be lit)\n \n
Spread Speed Multiplier
How fast fire spreads, as a multiplier (2 means twice as fast, 0.5 means half as fast)\n\nAKA encouragement multiplier\n \n
Tick Delay
The number of game ticks before fire blocks update themselves\n\nThe lower you set this, the faster fire works (in every way)\n \n
Tick Delay Randomization
By default, MC adds 0-9 ticks to each tick delay\n\nThe lower you set this, the faster fire works (in every way), and the less random it works, time-wise (but not to any noticeable degree for the latter)\n \n
