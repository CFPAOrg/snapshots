Global Multipliers
Multipliers for how fast fire naturally spreads and how fast fire burns blocks\n\nAlso includes the setting for how often fire updates (which makes everything fire-related faster or slower)\n \n
Special Toggles
Includes whether certain sources can start fires, whether fire ignores rain, and other oddities\n \n
Burn Spread Chances
These determine how often fire spreads to adjacent blocks after burning a block\n \n
Fire Spread Ranges / Reach
How far fire can naturally spread from one block to another in each direction\n \n
Spread Strengths (Advanced)
How much "life" new fires have when spreading\n \n
Block-Specific Settings (Advanced)
Block Transformations
This allows you to set what a block will become when it burns\nEg. you can make grass blocks turn to dirt by using this setting:\nminecraft:grass, minecraft:dirt\n\nKeep in mind that this won't do anything unless you make sure the first block is actually flammable (and maybe give it encouragement too, depending; see the MC wiki for more info on those stats)\n \n
Burn Speed Multiplier
How fast blocks are destroyed (burnt) when 'on fire', as a multiplier (2 means twice as fast, 0.5 means half as fast)\n\nAKA flammability multiplier\n\nSet this to 0 to make it so fire doesn't break (burn) blocks at all (but can still be lit)\n \n
Spread Speed Multiplier
How fast fire spreads, as a multiplier (2 means twice as fast, 0.5 means half as fast)\n\nAKA encouragement multiplier\n \n
Tick Delay
The number of game ticks before fire blocks update themselves\n\nThe lower you set this, the faster fire works (in every way)\n \n
Tick Delay Randomization
By default, MC adds 0-9 ticks to each tick delay\n\nThe lower you set this, the faster fire works (in every way), and the less random it works, time-wise (but not to any noticeable degree for the latter)\n \n
Ignore Humid Biomes
If set to true, fire ignores the fire resistance of humid biomes\n\nThis affects block destruction (burn) chance and natural fire spread chance in humid biomes\n \n
Ignore Rain
If set to true, fire ignores rain\n\nWHEN IT'S RAINING this affects chance of fire extinguishing from rain, chance of natural fire spread, and chance of fire spread when fire destroys (burns) a block\n \n
Disable Fires From Lava
Whether fire spreading from lava is disabled\n \n
Disable Fires From Lightning
Whether fire spreading from lightning is disabled\n \n
LOS-Only Fire Spread
Whether fire requires line-of-sight to spread to a new location\n \n
Max Burn Spread Chance
When a fire at the MAXIMUM age (15 in vanilla) destroys (burns through) a block, the chance that the broken (burnt) block is replaced with fire\n\nDoes nothing if fire never destroys blocks, eg. if dontDestroyBlocks is set to true\n\nUses a full-number percentage (25 means 25% chance, 75 means 75% chance)\n \n
Min Burn Spread Chance
When a fire at the MINIMUM age (0 in vanilla) destroys (burns through) a block, the chance that the broken (burnt) block is replaced with fire\n\nDoes nothing if fire never destroys blocks, eg. if dontDestroyBlocks is set to true\n\nUses a full-number percentage (25 means 25% chance, 75 means 75% chance)\n \n
Reach (Upwards)
The maximum upward distance fire can naturally spread to when updating (eg. between two trees)\n \n
Reach (Downwards)
The maximum downward distance fire can naturally spread to when updating (eg. between two trees)\n \n
Reach (Sideways)
The maximum horizontal distance fire can naturally spread to when updating (eg. between two trees)\n \n
Spread Strength (Block Destroyed)
When fire spreads by destroying a block, the new fire's duration is set to the duration of the fire it came from, multiplied by this\n\nFire's lifetime is only measured in integers from 0 to 15, so if you set the percentage to anything lower than 7 it will be the same as if you set it to 0\n\nUses a full-number percentage (25 means 25% strength, 75 means 75% strength)\n\nThe normal vanilla fire mechanics don't use a percentage reduction like this, so set this to -1 if you want vanilla mechanics in this regard\n \n
Spread Strength (Natural Spread)
When fire spreads naturally, ie. not when it's spreading by destroying (burning) a block, the new fire's duration is set to the duration of the fire it came from, multiplied by this\n\nFire's lifetime is only measured in integers from 0 to 15, so if you set the percentage to anything lower than 7 it will be the same as if you set it to 0\n\nUses a full-number percentage (25 means 25% strength, 75 means 75% strength)\n\nThe normal vanilla fire mechanics don't use a percentage reduction like this, so set this to -1 if you want vanilla mechanics in this regard\n \n
