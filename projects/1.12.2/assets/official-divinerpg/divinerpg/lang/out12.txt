Hitchak sure is tasty.
Zelus won't stop looking at me.
Can you feel the empowerment of the arcanium around you?
I hear there's no end to this place, there's no end to me either.
Arcana come upon me, give me the ultimate strength!
I've discovered how to awake the ancient leader of the dungeon.
Hurr drah drah, magic.
My weapons will conquer any foe.
Do not buy from Captain Merik. He does not care about quality.
The Arcanite Blade is incredibly powerful.
Have you seen Leorna lately? She's looking mighty fine as far as I can tell.
My minions will overrun any world.
I'm thinking of giving Leorna a flower, she won't find it too fancy though.
I've always wondered, does Leorna like plants because she almost is one?
Mmm. I'm hungry.
Can you come a little closer?
You need to fatten yourself up.
Let's go out to dinner. You'll be cooking.
You look new around here. Be careful.
Take these. Use them at an infusion table.
Don't tell anybody you saw me.
You're progressing. Good, good.
Can you hear the screams and roars from above?
Every time you infuse something, the gods become stronger.
The gods are using your dreams as a battlefield.
Infuse this. I can feel the strength when you do.
Thank you for aiding me in my plan.
The surface is just above us.
Can you believe that we're submerged so far?
You're safer down here.
Beware of the higher layers.
Take this reward, use it wisely.
What the future holds is dark.
This isn't a nice world.
You are moving upwards, beware of the imminent danger.
These places aren't for you.
This is dangerous, what are you doing here?
Temples are suited for humans.
They are getting closer to killing you.
So you came to play a game?
Let the game begin!
I heard you like explosions! Hahaha
Hahahaha
I'm here for you to meet your doom!
C'mon c'mon get me, try your best!
You can't kill me! You weak excuse for a human
Die before me!
Enough of you! You don't deserve my kill!
