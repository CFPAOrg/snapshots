Try to move me, I dare you.
My efforts to merge elements shall not be in vain.
I will attain perfect control.
Dedication brings unparalleled might.
Bath in flames, thrive!
Controlled power can bring both energy and destruction.
Do not try move me.
Burn them all! With Ice of course.
Embrace my roots.
My path cannot be stopped.
Nothing shall break my roots!
I see sparks all around me.
I will be safe when my enemies are dead.
Forever lasting.
I will pay any price to continue!
All blood will be mine, eventually.
What is frozen is as good as dead.
Swallow flames, harness Lightning.
Those who dared to follow had long since died.
Come on, hit me!
Not even mountains can bar my path!
Strike with Accuracy, strike once.
Fire brews wherever I walk.
Sparks fly, heads roll.
Toughest Opponents fear no pain.
Harness Fire, wield it as your weapon. Incinerate them.
Crystal clear and yet so incredibly tough.
Ice forms wherever I walk.
I see flames all around me.
Sparks fly wherever I stand.
What can't kill me only makes me glow brighter.
My life may be limited, but I shine throughout it.
I am a Fortress of pure Ice.
Jade is only worth after it is polished.
Energy is everywhere, it just begs to be grasped
What mortals can't see belongs to me.
Flow to me.
Heavenly Lightning? I call it mana.
Won't break? Smash harder!
I will take down my enemies with me, in flames.
One becomes two, two becomes four!
I seek strength only in nature.
Embrace my flames.
Swift as the Wind.
Command Thunder, command Energy.
Nature comes to my aid.
My efforts to merge elements shall not be in vain.
Leave only ashes behind.
The process of multiplying energy has just begun!
