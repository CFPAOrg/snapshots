HUD Position
The position of the HUD, represented by an expression. The expression can use mathematical symbols, as well as 2 defined variables: $w and $h, representing scaled width and height respectively.
Autumn Foliage Color
The color multiplier applied to each RGB component of the original foliage color during autumn
Heat
Settings regarding Body Heat mechanics
Enable Heat

Cave Temperature
The ambient temperature of caves
Distribution Vector
The conductivity distribution vector. Describes how much conductivity each armor piece contributes to the total.
Proximity Scaling
A value indicating the smoothness of radiant heat transition.
Temperature Coefficient
The number used to convert biome temperatures to Survival Inc scale. Commonly used value is the Schoperation's constant (78.0)
Wetness Multiplier
The multiplier applied to the wetness fraction used to calculate heat exchange modifier.
Heat Exchange Factor
How quickly you can heat up when you are in the desert? (units/tick)
Block Heat Map
A list of block registry names and their radiant heat, separated by a single space character.
Armor Conductivity
The conductivity of individual armor materials. Each entry contains name of armor material (enum), and their associated conductivity multiplier.
Fire Duration
When the player passes certain temperature, they catch on fire. Fire duration is the additional time in seconds this fire lasts after returning to normal. Setting this to 0 disables catching on fire, and uses Hyperthermia damage instead.
