Increases the throughput of machines
Adds 100000 to the maximum RF
Reduces voltage losses with increasing radius
Add 5 to max radius
Adds 5 to the max voltage or 100,000 to the max RF
HP Regeneration and not only
Will you test your luck?
Very strange module
This module can bite your finger
The current is dangerous!
Do you like plants?
What could be better than teleports?
Ooooh, this is lava!
In my childhood I did not know how to swim, so I walked on water
It will save you from overvoltage, probably
Gas flows take me to the world of miracles
Protection to the full!
Very dangerous toy
You assume that this cable conducts RF
Generates an electric field
Melts what melts
Destroys what is destroyed
Assemble any details
Sawing wooden objects
Converts the frequency of the field
Generates energy from nothing. It's probably a joke
Polluting the planet and producing electricity
This block will eat all your lava
The best block in mode! You can see for yourself
Converts field back to RF
Leads the charge of air to the ground
Stores energy
Emits red stone signal under certain conditions
Allows the release of nuclear power
Adds 1000 degrees to the maximum temperature
A lot of food? Convert it into energy
The movement is also a force
Conventional miniature solar panels
Get extra energy from the air
Lava has a large internal energy. This module will take it under its control
The newest invention
When activated, the lightning hits all around, except for its owner
Visualizes the connections of machines and the radius of the field
Shows the characteristics of creatures
Allows you to create markers
Scans and projects the map into your brain
Device for transfer of energy between capacitors
Takes dangerous lightning strikes
Part of the lightning rod
Shows how much the environment is charged

The detector behaves strangely
Very low charge
Low charge
Enough charge
A lot of charge
Very very much charge
[Extreme Energy]: You don't have implant
[Extreme Energy]: You already have one implant
[Extreme Energy]: You don't have modules in implant
[Extreme Energy]: You don't have armor core in implant
[Extreme Energy]: You don't have energy to do this action
You feel how the ground jumps out from under your feet
Your hair on the body is electrified
A spark flashed between your hands
You feel the air around you being electrified
You got a charge of energy
You got a strong discharge of electricity directly from the air
An electrical charge began to flow through your clothes. You are shining
The air began to lift you
Oops ... It looks like a powerful field has knocked all the electrons out of your battery in the implant
Press shift to show craft
[Extreme Energy]: You did not enter a name for the marker
[Extreme Energy]: Marker with this name already exists

If true, frequency will show in waila tooltip
PotionElectricShock ID
Under what ID this potion will be registered
Maximum chunk reserve
Determines how much maximum RF can accommodate the chunk
ParticleCustomPortal ID
Under what ID this particle will be registered
Maximum radius of teleportation
Defines the maximum radius for teleportation by the field converter
Nuclear explosion after reactor overheating
Will there be a nuclear explosion when the nuclear reactor overheats
Charged crystals
Will the crystals be charged when they drop from the ore? If false, they will be stacked and will not cause damage to the player.
Random chunk charge
If true, then the charge of the chunk will be completely randomly generated, else it will be medium (standard false, so that there are no annoying lightning throughout the map)
