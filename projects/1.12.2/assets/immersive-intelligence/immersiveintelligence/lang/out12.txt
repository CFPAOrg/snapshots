Data router allows to direct a packet into a specific side, which is defined by one of the packet's variables (can be set on the router by sneak using hammer). The variable has to be an integer.<br>Top - 0<br>Bottom - 1<br>North - 2<br>South - 3<br>East - 4<br>West - 5
The redstone buffer is a device which can hold an incoming data packet, until it doesn't receive a redstone signal.
The timed buffer is a device, which can hold an incoming data packet for a given amount of time. The duration is set by the variable '0' (a number of ticks to wait).
The small data buffer is a device which can hold up to 4 packets and can release them using the First-In-First-Out method when given a redstone signal.
Data Wiring
Not really powerlines
Trough the wires, data is sent and received immediately. In some cases using <link;radio_station;§o§nWireless §o§nTransmission§r;> might be better, but wires offer better stability during harsh weather and are cheaper.
Data wires like most cabling have their own relays and connectors, which split and connect machines. These can be used to create great logistic, warfare, intelligence and production networks.

Intelligence
Science's most powerful weapon
Intelligence is a branch of engineering focused on espionage, infiltration, sabotage and reconnaissance.<br>Intelligence offers multiple tools and machines to observe and predicate enemy movements. These include simple ones like the Binoculars and advanced like the Infrared Observer or Strategic Command Table.
