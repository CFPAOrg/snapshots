Can't attach motor belts to a wire connector
One does not simply attach belts to a wire system
As I said, you CAN'T connect them, stop trying
Listen to me, if you try to connect them once again...
WHAT PART OF YOU CAN'T ATTACH BELTS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND?!
Just leave me alone... Dummkopf! Here, have an advancement, and now f**k off!
You're really boring, even i, MotorBeltUtils.java have feelings, ok?!
You cannot attach this belt here
You are in the wrong dimension
You cannot attach a belt to the same point
You are too far away from the previous connection
The connection is obstructed
The connection exists already
One of the connection points is invalid
