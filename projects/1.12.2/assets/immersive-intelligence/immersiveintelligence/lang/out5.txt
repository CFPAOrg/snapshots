Controlling the Flow
When you want to control an automated factory, power plant or a different complicated structure you need some kind of a control system. <br>Redstone is good for a start, but with lots of machines the messy nature of it starts to show - and that's an appropriate moment to introduce The Data System.
Data, in contrast to a redstone signal, is sent in a asynchronous way via packets. This means, that the signal isn't being sent all the time, but only once. Each packet can contain 36 <link;data_variable_types;§n§oVariables§r;> of different types, labelled by one of the 26 letters and numbers 0-9. The packets are received and sent instantly, allowing them to travel vast distances without any loss in data they store.
Variable Types
Results May Vary
There are multiple types of the variables a packet can hold. Each one has a default value (not to be confused with <link;data_variable_types_null;§o§nNull§r;>) and other parameters specific to their type.<br> The basic types are: <link;data_variable_types_null;§o§nNull§r;>, <link;data_variable_types_int;§o§nInteger§r;>, <link;data_variable_types_string;§o§nString§r;>, <link;data_variable_types_bool;§o§nBoolean§r;>, there are also a couple of more advanced types like <link;data_variable_types_itemstack;§o§nItemStack§r;>, <link;data_variable_types_array;§o§nArray§r;>, <link;data_variable_types_pair;§o§nPair§r;> and <link;data_variable_types_range;§o§nRange§r;>.
