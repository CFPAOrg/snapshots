To make a campfire, place tinder on the ground, add logs, and light it.
To use a pit kiln, first dig a hole in the ground and place the pit kiln inside. Next, place the item you want to fire in the pit kiln, place a straw block, and place three logs on top. Finally, light the top of the kiln and be sure to keep it dry while it fires!
To perform pit burning, place the blocks to burn in a pit and make sure all sides are covered with solid, non-flammable blocks, leaving one hole exposed. Light the blocks and quickly cover the hole. The entire contents must be covered with full, non-flammable blocks to succeed. When contents stop smoking, the burn is complete. To collect fluid from the burn, place collectors under the blocks.
Refractory burning is similar to pit burning with the exception that the burning blocks must be fully covered with valid refractory blocks. To collect fluid from the burn, place a valid refractory collector under the blocks.
