Build a Blood Well.
Shoggoth
Shoggoths.<BR>Shapeless masses of flesh, washed away aeons ago on the Sea's shores.<BR>Slaves to the Elder Things, builders of cities.<BR>They're born from tears.<BR>I must create a Shoggoth Vat. That is, a 3x3x3 cube of tears, making sure each block is filled. Then three Fleti must be placed in it.<BR>Once all is done, I must enter it, and through a Dream Bottle I must Dream simultaneously of Darkness, Eldritchness, Learning and Void.<BR>A Shoggoth is no gentle creature. It will attack all animals and all Players other than its owner on sight. If it becomes too delighted in killing, then not even its owner is safe.<BR>A Shoggoth is to be picked up through a blackjack, provided that it is sufficiently calm.
City Mapping
Shoggoths once built cities.<BR>They shall do so again.
A City Mapper can create a map schematic that is then to be given to a Shoggoth.<BR>I can place buildings from the menu on the right onto the map. Buildings must not intersect each other and must be fully contained within the map's borders.<BR>Buildings can be rotated before or after placement with the mouse wheel.<BR>Buildings on the map can be moved by clicking on them and deleted by moving them outside the map.<BR>I must save changes before exiting the Mapper and before creating the schematic.<BR>Once the schematic is made, I can then give it to a Shoggoth.<BR>Of course, I must also make sure the Shoggoth isn't distracted by any animals, other Players or other Shoggoths.<BR>As of now, there's only a handful of block types the Shoggoth can create. Maybe in the future I'll find more.<BR>The Shoggoth creates such blocks by itself, but I can synthesize them myself as well, if needs be.<BR>Lastly, I should remember to light up buildings soon after they're built, as they have no source of lighting themselves.
Craft a City Mapper.
Clinic
The Clinic seems to have been designed specifically for Weepers and Fleti, it seems.<BR>A bizarre discovery, given how ancient its design must be. How long have Weepers existed for?<BR>Its interior is split in multiple chambers. Each one contains a chiseled block in the floor, where a Lacrymatory is meant to be placed.
