Tear a heart.
Weepers
The person I once was would've reeled in disgust at the idea of ripping spines and tearing hearts. Now I barely flinch.<BR>But this..? This new idea that springs forth in my mind, through the uncanny doings of The Great Dreamer? Even now my hands tremble.<BR>To fill their brains with water, to make them SEE things as they truly are. Their brains filled, so they may only weep.
A tear is a revelation. All should fear the ones who weep, for they know more than most.<BR>A Weeper is a Villager whose head was enlarged to monstruos size, filled by water.<BR>A Fletum is a Weeper who's lost its spine. It needs no body, it is whole within its head.<BR>They Dream, they learn, they weep. I must harvest their tears, they are knowledge.
It is most natural to weep when one learns something. The sudden realization of one's own insignificance is no small deal, after all.<BR>It should not be held back, nor frowned upon, for tears are precious. A sign of humility before the Truth, and all that it entails.<BR>A Lacrymatory is where one should weep, in case one wishes to preserve their tears, to be then picked up through buckets. For some reason, when fallen into the Lacrymatory their power does not expire.<BR>And so it is, that Weepers and Fleti come to usefulness. A Weeper can be picked up directly through the use of a blackjack, whereas a Fletum requires only my bare hands, while sneaking, disgusting as it may be.<BR>Both of them can be used upon the Lacrymatory, and they'll weep in it. They must not wander far, and thus it is important to build around them so they don't escape.<BR>Additionally, only one of them can be used per Lacrymatory, and no two of them, whether they be Weeper or Fletum, should be too close to each other. No less than three blocks, per say.<BR>After all, how many times have I cried in my loneliness?
