Your actions did:not deserve such:punishment.
There is no right answer. :But know that I{ despise} those who think the way you do.
That is what we think as well. :Yet your forefathers knew better, it seems.
It matters not. Let the past stay past, we are not the ones who may walk through time. Only speak.
Granting me a few last words? |Thank you, traveller. :I'll make it quick.
Let's start from an objective Truth. A mathematical one. :The greatest number you could ever think of is nothing to infinity.
Another Truth. I am insignificant. :There are countless others exactly like me in this very world. Exact copies. :I am just a bunch of ifs and fors, so irrelevant that you would mete out my death with barely any hesitation.
My question, outsider, is this. :Do you really claim a mind of infinite complexity? I am sorry to say but, that's not the way it is. Billions upon billions of synapses, yet, sooner or later, even your mind could be copied. Just like mine.
That is a snippet of Truth, outsider, just for you. Your life is worth naught.
It does not matter what world you come from, the Truth spans all realms. | :Because it lies Beyond The Veil, in the region between all universes.
Go ahead, strike me down. My death won't matter. || :And neither will yours.
Oh my! A traveller! |:Hello! Hi! Greetings! Welcome! Salutations!
I am this Hamlet's Scholar! A rare profession nowadays. :Haha. Most of us are dead.
No worries though. Thou art a friend, ain't ya? |:Feel free to browse the Town Hall.
See thee later, dude.
Oi, art thou dabblin' in the art of Weeper making? |:Nice.
Ya know, back in the day we used to make Weepers too. :Then we stopped, since some people didn't like that practice of ours, and in the end we had enough to weep of our own!
Yeah, things were tough back then. :My friends named me Weeper Ad Honorem after me pa and me ma were.. ya know..
We still weep at times, absorbed in recollection. :So please, friend, hearken our chants. :And weep with us.
