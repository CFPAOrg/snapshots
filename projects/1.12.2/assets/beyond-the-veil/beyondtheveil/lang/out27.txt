To whoever is unfortunate enough to come into possession of these writings..<BR>Stop reading for a moment. Look at your skin. Take a second to admire it. Your own, beautiful, candid skin.<BR>Now imagine. Imagine it turning blue. Slowly losing its color. Imagine then seeing it crack and break like dried stone.<BR>Imagine seeing it replaced, replaced by hard blue scales, surrounded by greenish mucus. Slimy, sticky, smelly, this horror is none other than yourself.<BR>Your head thrown forwards, your jaw opening three-ways, your spine bursting into a dorsal fin.<PAGE>I've always held my own self somewhat in contempt, for my insecurities, my failures, my flaws.<BR>This new shape is a blessing.<BR>I am remade in the shape of God. Or, at least, of His Archpriest Dagon.<BR>I am perfect, a wonderful horror.<BR>In my love and hatred for this form, I'll say it's one of power. I acquire great strength and resistance to harm, especially underwater.<BR>I, however, also lose the ability to wear armor and to wield any items other than a handful of marine ones, such as slugs and fish.<BR>There's more to this power than I currently know, I'm sure. I'll need to look for other abilities this shape has.<BR>I thank You, Dagon, for now I am Deep.
Eat a slug in the deepest oceans.
Slay three Elder Guardians. Commune.
Dream Bottle
I shed a tear when I was baptised.<BR>A sliver of Truth, it was, reminding me of my worthlessness.<BR>And yet, it was that very tear that led me to *know*.<BR>I cannot amass my own tears, I am no professional Weeper, am I?<BR>Am I?<BR>I'll seek help in bodies other than mine.
Through Weepers and Fleti I am granted knowledge, and through Dreams I shall utilize and magnify such knowledge.<BR>A Dream Bottle is what I must craft. An invaluable tool that will let me Dream limitless times per day, with multiple Memories at a time.<BR>The only price will be tears. But not my own.
