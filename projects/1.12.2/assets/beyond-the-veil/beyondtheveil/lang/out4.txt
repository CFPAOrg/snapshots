IT IS NOT ALLIANCE I SEEK
YOU WILL SERVE ME
GRAND REWARDS AWAIT YOUR SUCCESS
UNSPEAKABLE CONSEQUENCES WILL FOLLOW YOUR FAILURES
YOU ARE MY HERALD
BRING THIS GOLD TO THE DWELLERS
SO THAT THEY MAY KNOW YOU AS MY AMBASSADOR
THEN COMMUNE WITH GOD'S IDOL
I WILL HEAR YOU
These three golden blocks must be brought to the Fisherman Dwellers. We should make haste.
YOU WILL JOIN MY RANKS
PROVE YOUR WORTH TO ME
SLAY THREE OF MY ELDER GUARDIANS
THEN COMMUNE WITH GOD'S IDOL
Three Elder Guardians, in their ancient ocean monuments. A trifle, right?
