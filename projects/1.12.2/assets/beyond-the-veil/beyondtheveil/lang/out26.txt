I was born from water, like all things that be. I live by water, my means of Holy Communion.<BR>Now, I am water.<BR>Now, I am something. I hope.<BR>To know more of the Truth means to know less of myself. Am I truly a worthless wretch?<BR>My certainties grow weaker.
Talk with the Lighthouse Keeper.
Drown. Then the Idol. 
Alliance
In time, I shall grow yet stronger.<BR>But where is it I go from now?<BR>I must wait for signs. There is nothing I can do by myself.. nothing.
DAGON.<BR>Ancient scrolls speak of Him in hushed tones, proclaiming Him the Ruler of the Abyss, King of the Deep Ones.<BR>The first and foremost worshipper of The Great Dreamer.<BR>He noticed me. He sent a Deep One to my aid, though temporarily.<BR>Have I impressed Him? Could He be seeking an Alliance of sorts?<BR>Now that my research leaves the scope of the Dwellers' knowledge, it is time to seek greater aid.<BR>Dagon, I accept Your offer, and I shall speak with You again at the bottom of the Ocean.
It RINGS inside of me.<BR>His voice, like a booming drum of war, not asking but COMMANDING.<BR>Three golden blocks I've been given. I shall give them to the grey robed fisherman Dwellers of the Hamlet, then commune.<BR>I have no intention to learn what would happen were I to disobey.<BR>Oh, what have I gotten myself into.
By The Great Dreamer.. I was mistaken.<BR>Dagon has offered me a boon like no other.<BR>By holding myself into a stance of power I am capable of summoning a Deep One to my aid. Hold to choose, tap to cast.<BR>Is this power worth it? And the knowledge that comes with it?<BR>I will journey forth. After all.. do I have any choice?
Wait. Hope.
Eat a slug in the deepest oceans.
Bring the gold to the Dwellers. Commune.
Metamorphosis
Dagon calls me.<BR>I must speak with Him again.<BR>I cannot escape.
The Guardians in the Ocean Monuments.. belong to Dagon?<BR>Yet He asks me to slay them, merely as a test. He must pass Judgement upon me.<BR>What does He mean with "join His ranks"? Do I not serve Him already?
