Far from perfect, Dreams of Darkness still prove useful in seeking Voided Biomes within limited range.<BR>However, I fear disappointment. Could some black grains of sand truly grant us enlightenment? I think not.<BR>Maybe I should instead focus on seeking the Fishing Hamlets that are rumoured to appear in these places.<BR>I know very well that not all Voided biomes will hold a Hamlet, so my research may take very long. I can comfort myself, knowing how much of the world I'll discover in my travels.<BR>Yet I am left to wonder, how much of it is real, and how much is naught but a wretched lie?<BR>After learning there is so much Beyond our world, so much more than meets the eye.. I am left in agonizing doubt.
Dream of Darkness.
The Fishing Hamlet
I need the Truth. I am sick of lies.<BR>There is a Veil of illusions clouding everyone's mind, there has to be. Everything I see, is a Lie.<BR>NOTHING BUT A LIE.<BR>I must breach it. I must see Beyond that barrier.<BR>Whether the Fishing Hamlet is the key to the Arcanum, or merely a piece of a grand puzzle, we shall see.
This can't be..<BR>All this work, all this research.. led me here?!<BR>To a bunch of degenerates?! Of xenophobic nitwits?!?<BR>Nonono, I can't stop now. I can breach the Veil. I know I can. I know it. I really do.<BR>I need to talk with the Lighthouse Keeper. I hope he proves wiser than his fellow Dwellers.
Look at the Ocean.. look at the Ocean..
Locate a Fishing Hamlet.
Talk with the Lighthouse Keeper.
Communion
At times, we think of ourselves as gods. Allmighty, invincible gods to whom the whole world must bow. Gods whose creations could reshape the world entire.<BR>And we're no more than deluded fools.<BR>The Ocean.<BR>Immense, timeless, inscrutable. Could it really care of what we do? Could it really, when it dwarfs our greatest, grandest structures, when it outlives our strongest, toughest contraptions?<BR>A symbol of immensity, ever close, to remind us of our INSIGNIFICANCE.<BR>The Ocean, whose immensity the Hamlet Dwellers seem so fascinated by, is UNKNOWABLE. We could spend whole eternities in the hope of researching its every nook and cranny, and yet vainly, for in its boundlessness, as well as its ever changing, chaotic nature, the things that lie within it.. or beneath it.. will always elude us. Unless they come to us.<BR>Yes, the Ocean must be the key. In its boundless, unkowable immensity, it is SURE to conceal what we're looking for. Some kind of gateway, some sort of door that will let us see Beyond the Veil. In its bottomless depths, we must look for rifts.<BR>Water itself REEKS of Eldritchness, and especially in that Hamlet of bizarre degenerates worshipping some kind of.. of..<BR>Yes. Of.. of course. They're far from degenerates, for they found the solution far before US.<BR>If their Deity truly is a manifestation of what's Beyond the Veil, hiding the Truth from us all, and if their fascination with Dreams and the Ocean is of the same nature as ours.. then we must seek Communion.<BR>Communion with the Great Dreamer.
