Craft a Lacrymatory.
Ring of Revelation
Weepers and Fleti lack eyes, yet they see more than most.<BR>Their tears are precious, and I shall dampen a ring with them.
The Ring of Revelation lets me see the unseen.<BR>When its passive effect is turned on, all invisible entities shall be revealed to me.<BR>When its active power is used, all such entities will outright lose their invisibility, leaving them for the whole world to see.<BR>Nothing shall lie unseen to me again.
Craft a Ring of Revelation.
Bleeding Belt
As my knowledge grows, so does my life become more precious.<BR>It must be preserved.<BR>I will gladly make sacrifices, of all kinds.<BR>Blood is the key.
When worn, the Bleeding Belt oozes the dark red fluid, of unknown origin for it isn't mine.<BR>What I do know is that, when its passive effect is enabled, it bathes me with life in exchange for hunger.<BR>Any time I am struck, my health shall be unharmed for as long as my stomach isn't empty.
Craft a Bleeding Belt.
Bone Tiara
If it is true that one must fight fire with fire, then I shall be the first to fight fear with fear.<BR>No terrors shall break my will.
The things I see as my knowledge grows send shivers down my spine.<BR>Hopefully, they'll now send them through someone else's.<BR>A tiara of bones will now adorn my head. As long as its passive effect is on, I shall be immune to Terror and Folly. My will will not break.<BR>Not yet.
Craft a Bone Tiara.
Covenant of Blood
Through blood, different lives are linked.<BR>The dark red fluid is not of this world, and the links are of eldritch nature. I may find use for such bonds, yet this time I cannot do it alone. I need other Players.
The relation between blood and water grows ever closer.<BR>All life came from water, after it turned to blood. All life is linked by this one origin.<BR>The Covenant of Blood is based upon these links. When I activate it while submerged in water, I will for a few brief moments see all other Players who, like me, wear the ring and are waterborne.<BR>When looking at one of them, activating the ring again will let me instantaneously travel to my ally.
