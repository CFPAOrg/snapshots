The Dream Bottle stores tears. It can be used on a Lacrymatory to be filled up to its maximum capacity, and used again to be emptied as much as possible.<BR>It can store up to 4 buckets of tears.<BR>It can then be used without sneaking to be filled with Memories, up to four.<BR>Now, whenever I drink the Bottle's contents while sneaking I will be able to Dream anywhere, anytime, as many times as I want.<BR>One bucket of tears for every Dream, that's the exchange rate.<BR>As I learn of this new tool, new possibilities open up to me in the art of Dreaming.
Find a way to gather tears.
Craft a Dream Bottle.
Addendum:<BR>It seems that being worshipped through the use of a statue slightly improves the Dream-to-Tears efficiency of the Bottle.
Water Walking
Great Father Dagon, I am coming.
The End is engulfed in Void, the outer bulwark of the Veil, of The Great Dreamer Himself.<BR>It is there that I must Dream, while in water. I must Dream of Darkness, of Eldritch, of Learning and of Void, all at the same time. I know this, somehow.<BR>I cannot use a bed or a Sleep Chamber while in water, so I must take a third route to Dream.
Water Walking is the art of becoming one with the Ocean.<BR>When I use the power, while in water, I will be transported to any location or entity I am looking at, provided they are also in water.<BR>Additionally, using it while sneaking will set a waypoint. Doing that again will transport me back to that waypoint, then deleting it.<BR>Truly, I am now ever closer to the Ocean, a part of its very essence.<BR>A tiny, insignificant part in its unknowable immensity.
Eat a slug in the deepest oceans.
Bathe in the End and Dream. Then Commune.
Watery Cradle
Useless worms plague this world, living in their placid isles of ignorance.<BR>The Great Dreamer teaches me how best to employ them.<BR>I will make their bodies, maybe their corpses, mine to experiment upon.<BR>They are insignificant, after all.
