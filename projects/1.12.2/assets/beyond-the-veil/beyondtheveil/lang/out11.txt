We Dwellers can't breathe water from the moment we're born. No, it comes later.
It is only through endless devotion to The Great Dreamer that an outsider such as you may be granted this Gift. :To us it's different. Genetic. I won't mention the details.
But ultimately, for both of our kinds it is only through an act of faith that we may be granted the Gift. |:You must drown.
There is a ritual that must be made. I could explain it to you, yet I am certain that that voice in your head will take care of it.
I still remember when I underwent the ritual. You will too.
I was under the water, I couldn't breathe, I was going to die, I knew I was and I regretted it, I regretted everything and I couldn't breathe and they had lied to me and they had left me to drown and I had to believe but I couldn't and I was dying and I BREATHE. :In. And out. In. And out. Again. And again.
That was my Baptism. Soon, you shall have yours.
Good luck, friend.
Ah, I Dreamt of you tonight. You wish to tell me something.
The drunken one:told me:everything.
Have you:always been:victims?
And you would trust the words of an old, insane drunken fool? |:Why, of course you should. You'll find that insanity brings one closer to Truth, for better or worse.
The drunken one appeared in my Dream as well. :It was him who told you something, wasn't he?
From his words, an old Truth arises. :MY ancestors' traditions went too far at times. Sacrifices, murders, experiments.
Blood lays in the black sand beneath us. They did it for power, through unholy pacts. The Great Dreamer, or rather, his ArchPriest, demanded payment.
You didn't need this Truth. It would've only dissuaded you from your goal. :You see? I had to hide it.  My own Veil, of sorts.
That, however, does not excuse in the slightest that which happened to us. :No sin is great enough to justify GENOCIDE.
You did wrong.:Punishment was:due.
