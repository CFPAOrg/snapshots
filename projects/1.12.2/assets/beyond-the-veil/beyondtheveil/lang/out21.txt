Contacting the Unknowable
If it's true that all Dreams go through the Void, then chances are I am not the only Dreamer whose quest for knowledge focuses there.<BR>It is time to unVeil the Truth. Time for me to contact other Dreamers. No matter the risk, no matter how great or powerful they may be, or what intentions they may have.<BR>No matter what they may be, how different, how alien they may prove to me.<BR>No matter where they come from. From what world, time, reality.<BR>Nothing matters now. This may very well be the end of my research. If it must be like that, so be it, and I hope these notes prove useful to posterity.<BR>I must Dream of Eldritchness, under the influence of Void. I must fix my ears, to hear everything that is told to me. Listen as closely as I can. And be ready for a Dream longer than most.
Gracious Gods, don't let my mind crumble as I write this.<BR>A voice. It came from the Ocean. I didn't hear it, I felt it. Through my Dream it touched my body.<BR>It didn't speak to me, but through me, as if it didn't notice I was there, in my Dream.<BR>Yet I know now what I must do. The thought was imprinted in my mind.<BR>I must find the place where the blackness of the Void touches the surface, so I may see it and handle it myself.<BR>But, to be sincere, I do not know whether to continue in my search for knowledge...<BR><BR><BR>Merciful Gods, have mercy upon me.<BR>Don't let me drown.
Dream of Eldritch.
Finding Strongholds
It is of no surprise that Eldritch Dreams are correlated with the End, in its closeness to the Void.<BR>When not powered by a Void Dream, an Eldritch Dream will tell me the exact location of a single Stronghold.
Dreams of Dark
Before entering the Ocean, I could feel sand beneath my...  beneath my Dream. Dark, slimy sand, the color of Void.<BR>There are indeed reports of damp, blackened beaches, and, furthermore, rumour has it that some of these "Voided" biomes are inhabited by small groups of reclusive fishermen.<BR>I wonder if they can provide any clues towards my quest for knowledge. In any case, my goal now is to Dream of Darkness. A new, well imprinted Memory.
