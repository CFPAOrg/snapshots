The Dream reacted to my Memory of Metal by granting me knowledge of the presence of metals in the ground below.<BR>It responded to me. It's as if it was... sentient?<BR>It is bizarre, even somewhat unsettling.. and yet, I can't keep myself from wishing to know more, to shatter this facade of illusions clouding my mind from.. from this unknowable Truth.<BR>I'm sure new experiences will trigger new Memories that will grant new knowledge, and maybe other effects.<BR>I must keep going. Whenever I am stuck, it'll be wise to resort to a Memory of Learning.
Very similarly to Metal, a Memory of Crystal grants me knowledge of the earth beneath me, this time teaching me of the presence of crystals, namely diamonds and emeralds.
Dreams may go straight down, yet their knowledge of the world is vast.<BR>And through the making of a simple book, I'm reminded of those who inhabit this world.<BR>A Memory of Sentience, with which I can instruct my Dream to seek a society like that of a Village, and point me to it.
Dream of Metal.
Sleep Chamber
I'd always been proud of my ability to stay awake and work and walk as long as I needed, leaving sleep to times of absolute necessity.<BR>Oh, how ironic that now it is sleep I need, and can't get enough of it.<BR>I must Dream, keep Dreaming, again and again. Once a day, only at night, is not enough, it just isn't. I shall focus my mind on the creation of some device capable of ridding me of that limit, at least partially.<BR>First, a proper crafting station. The Gear Bench will aid me in the creation of more complex objects.
This machine, which I named Sleep Chamber, is most curious. Its construction requires a knowledge of mechanics, biology and chemistry so far outside of my usual scope of knowledge that I would dare to deem it... alien?<BR>And yet it came to me, all of a sudden, not through experimentation, but seemingly by itself.<BR>Oh, I'll enquire on that mistery another time.<BR>The Chamber must be opened, and once I'm inside I must close it to start Dreaming. It is capable of putting me to sleep once per day, and wake me up immediately, without any time going by. And yet this istant is enough for the Dream to leave me and do its task as dictated by a nearby Fume Spreader, just like a normal bed.<BR>It is truly unbelievable, and yet I feel like I only scraped the surface of what this journey could lead me to.<BR>It is merely a stepping stone, to shatter all the fake truths I thought I knew.
