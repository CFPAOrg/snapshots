A precious knowledge, one that must be kept tight and silent.

Indeed, the Blood Sigil has forged an unbreakable bond.<BR>Through these Pathway Sigils I will be able to target specific locations.<BR>There is, however, another type of Sigil: the Player Sigil, that can bind a specific person to itself.<BR>More difficult to use, this one requires to be held in my hands, either main or offhand, as I injure another Player enough for them to bleed.<BR>Once their blood is in my hands, so too shall their fate be mine to dictate.

And what could other Dreamers do to me, were I to catch their attention?<BR>It's frightening.<BR>But hey, I got an apple!<BR>This Dream deserves further enquiry.
