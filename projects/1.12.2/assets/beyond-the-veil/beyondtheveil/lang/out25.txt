Gifts from the Deep
The Hamlet Dwellers' diet, other than slugs, consist mostly of fish. Their barrels are full of cod.<BR>It seems they use their canoes to go fishing. These are built by the carpenters, the Dwellers with dark brown suits who live in two-story houses with normal oak ladders.<BR>Not every Hamlet has carpenters, but they're fairly common.  
According to the carpenter, the Dweller Fishermen ride their canoes into the Ocean and.. the fish just come to them?<BR>I should attempt that as well, not just in any water but in those of the Ocean itself.<BR>If anything does in fact happen, I shall keep at it for a while, then top it off with a fair deal of slugs. After that, I shall commune.
The Ocean itself.. it answers to me, its crashing waves a soothing voice, its blue immensity a vigilant eye, its shapeless water a loving hand.<BR>I have a link with the Ocean now, I am stronger because of it, especially in the water that binds us.<BR>And yet, our link is not strong enough.. I am still a creature of the surface, am I not?
Talk with the Hamlet's carpenter.
Sail the Ocean with a Canoe, then commune.
Baptism
I was born from water, like all things that be. I live by water, my means of Holy Communion.<BR>So why can't I breathe it? Why does it still hinder my movement?<BR>It makes me strong, and at the same time weakens me.<BR>It grants me life, and yet it can kill me.<BR><BR>The Dwellers though.. they bask in its touch, even its depths. So why can't I?<BR>We must ask the Lighthouse Keeper, one last time.
I am immortal. Right? I am, am I not?<BR>Maybe it isn't death I fear, but failure. A fate even worse, I reckon. Over and over, it will drive me to madness. And what good is immortality then?<BR>The pool must be tight. One by one wide, and exactly five blocks deep, all of it filled by still water.<BR>I must let myself sink in it, and once I reach the bottom, I must commune, eating a slug.<BR>Then I'll wait. And I will believe, like never before.<BR>Merciful God, don't let me drown.
