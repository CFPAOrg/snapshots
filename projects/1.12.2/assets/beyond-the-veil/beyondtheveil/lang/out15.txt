Another player is located at x: %1$s, y: %2$s, z: %3$s. I am unaware of what dimension they're in.
Their name is %1$s.
Another player is currently wielding: %1$s.
Another player was found, but they were wielding nothing.
Their name starts with '%1$s'.
The Dream was unable to locate another player.
It seems that casting the Death Dream on myself allows me to teleport to my last death's location.
%1$s's last death in the Overworld was at x: %2$s, y: %3$s, z: %4$s.
%1$s doesn't seem to have died recently.
%1$s's mind is too well shielded to be breached.
I am certain this aspect will be of great aid very soon.
But now is not the time. I lack the strength.
As of now, I need to have dreamt of the Void for this to work.
Found Stronghold at x: %1$s, z: %2$s

To properly summon an animal, I should clear some space nearby, at my height level.

Beyond the Veil
Dreams
I must sleep. I must Dream.
The last trip I took to the Nether left me with a bizarre feeling. That of plunging down, through stone and bedrock, gods know how far into another realm.<BR>Truly, a bizarre feeling, one that felt to me weirdly.. weirdly..<BR>..nostalgic?<BR>Yes.. a weird nostalgia of an experience I've never lived. A memory that came all of a sudden, when last I dreamt.<BR>A dream. Why, that could indeed be the key!<BR>I must dream once more, I must peer into my own subconscious.  
Dreams are a thing of wonder.<BR>I once though they'd be merely a window into my own subconscious and yet there seems to be so much more to them than meets the eye.<BR>What if the things I saw in Dreams were not fiction, what if they were true?<BR>What if they showed me part of a great Truth invisible to all but a Dreamer?<BR>I must practice the art of Dreaming. I must be the one to uncover this Truth.<BR>I, and only I, must be the one.
