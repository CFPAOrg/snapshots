Craft a Covenant of Blood.
Crown of Thorns
If I am ever to be struck down, I want it to be by my own hand.<BR>Until then, I must defy death. Again and again.<BR>I need the WILL to LIVE.
Sprinkled with blood and dust of dorsal spines, the Crown of Thorns is a thing of horror.<BR>When its passive effect is active, it grants me the will and strength to keep standing after a blow that would've been final, piercing my forehead and bathing me in my own blood.<BR>Yet no boon comes without a price. After the effect takes hold I will be mortal again for a short period, at the end of which the damage that was negated will finally be dealt.<BR>I must use the Crown wisely, and be ready to heal.
Craft a Crown of Thorns.
Charm of Azacno
Aeons ago, a great parasite fell from the Cosmos.<BR>Unknown in shape and intent, it laid its nest in the deepest Oceans.<BR>Sucking blood, bringing fear and granting knowledge. To know him is to reach a culmination of my experiments.
Azacno was born from a rift in the Veil, yet not one from below our Oceans.<BR>Instead, he came from the stars, crashing into our waters, and communing with The Great Dreamer.<BR>He is of parasitical nature, and so are his followers. The Charm of Azacno is a feared talisman that infects the enemies of its wearer.<BR>Using its active power grants me for a few seconds the ability to infect others, unless they wear the Charm themselves.<BR>Monsters, animals and other mindless beasts will simply be driven back by the terror instilled by the infection.<BR>It is on other Players, however, that the effect is most terrible.<BR>An infected Player slowly succumbs more and more to the infection, as it grows worse and worse. In the end, the effects may even become visible to the eye.<BR>A fate that not even death will save one from. I do not know of any cures yet.<BR>It is of note that this charm is not magical in nature. It is merely a symbol by which Azacno recognizes me as one of his sect, and grants me this power.<BR>It is important I seek alliance with those others who worship The Great Dreamer.
