Dreams of Death
A Dream of Death, as I respawn once again.<BR>Yet I am not the only one that cannot truly die.<BR>With this Memory, I can invade the privacy of another random Player, and discover the last place where they died, hopefully profiting off their spoils.<BR>No grave is too sacred.
It seems that targeting myself with a Death Dream, through a Player Sigil bound to myself used on the Dream Shrine, allows me to outright teleport to my last Overworld death's location.<BR>But how? How can a simple Dream shift my whole body?<BR>Could this be a key to breaching the Veil?
Dreams of Mending
A Dream of Mending, as I smite the hammer on the anvil.<BR>I cannot truly die, yet many of my tools are fraught with mortality. This Memory influences the very matter I am surrounded with, and repairs the items I am wearing and wielding.
Dreams of Animals
A Dream of Animal, as I feed one with my own hands.<BR>Dropping a specific item near to me before I Dream of this Memory will spawn nearby an animal related to that item.<BR>Where my Dream plucks that creature from, I can only speculate.<PAGE>Examples of usable items would be porkchop for pigs, bones for wolves, leather for cows, horses and even llamas. Of course there are more to discover.
Dream Shrine
The Nether lies halfway between the Overworld and the Deepest Oceans. Surrounded by Void on both sides, it is closer to the true Void, the true Veil that lies beneath All.<BR>Even that accursed land of fire was born from water.<BR>Like all things that be.<BR>And even though it's small in surface compared to the Overworld, some Dreams go through it still.<BR>Quartz makes for a powerful conductor, not only of redstone but even of Dreams.<BR>A Shrine of Dreams, made of Quartz, to cast them wherever I desire. That is my new goal.<BR>All I require is a way to bind specific locations.. even specific people.. to focus my Dreams towards them.
