I humbly pledge my life to You, Great Dreamer.<BR>I disavow all my previous beliefs, any gods I may have previously believed in.<BR>I am insignificant to you. The Ocean, Your presence on the Overworld, is symbol of that.<BR>You are unknowable to me. The Void, full of emptiness, is Your inscrutable substance.<BR>Beyond You lie all things. The Truth, hidden by a Veil.<BR>Grant us knowledge, so we may undo all lies.<BR>Grant us strength, so we may survive the Truth.<BR>Grant us courage.. so we may hear Your Holy Voice.
Pray at the Idol in the Hamlet.
Slugs
To commune with The Great Dreamer is an honor of the highest order. Truly, to have made an impression on Him so as to have sparked His interest is, undoubtedly, the greatest achievement I have ever accomplished.<BR>Yet the strength of the communion is ever faint, for I am weak, and my presence hopelessly bound to the Overworld.<BR>He knows that. He wishes to aid me. Really, He does!<BR>Slimy, shapeless, uncatchable like the water from which they are born. Such are the white slugs on which some Dwellers of the Hamlet feed. They are the key.<BR>I need a bait, and The Great Dreamer provides me with knowledge of how to create one. How ironic, though meaningful, that those shapeless chaotic slugs are so attracted by the perfect, orderly shape of common salt!<BR>The slug bait must be placed in water. There must be no water on top of it, but it must be surrounded by water on its 4 sides. For best performance it should be in the center of an 11x11 square of water.<BR>If the requirements are met, and I am able to see the faintest of particles, I should soon see the watery essence of the slugs on the water surface. They seemingly appear from nothingness, and pop back out of existence in a few moments. I must aim carefully my slug catcher at them, and use it.<BR>Then.. I must eat them. It's the only way. I won't like, but I must.<BR>Once I've eaten a few, say, twenty or so, I must interact with the Idol again.
