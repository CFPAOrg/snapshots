This Statue is bound to someone other than me, and the link of blood cannot be broken.  
My blood bathes this Statue. It is now bound, our link unbreakable, unbreachable.
I do not know how to use this.
This Lacrymatory holds %1$s/4000 millibuckets of Tears.
I should not try to break it.
I shouldn't be doing this.
I should stop.
I should really stop.
Stop.
Stop it.
Stop it now.
You should really stop.

You fool.
You don't know what you're dealing with.

This Shoggoth is already building.. it wouldn't be wise to interrupt this thing, would it?
I should stop trying to command the Shoggoth while it's doing its own thing. It is dangerous.
Only a fool would try to divert a Shoggoth's attention upon themselves.. and I am no fool, am I??
Stop.

There is nothing in the Void.<BR>And yet everything comes from There.<BR>That black portal to Infinity.
Knowledge is to be feared,<BR>not sought.<BR>It may bring Power,<BR>but at what cost?
Infinite Yous throughout infinite moments,<BR>among infinite timelines<BR>within infinite Infinities.<BR>You are nothing. Do not forget that.
The deepest Oceans touch the Void.<BR>Water is unsafe, it is Chaos.<BR>Yet from it comes Life.
Deaths upon Deaths upon Deaths.<BR>But you are not truly immortal.<BR>You are nothing to Eternity.
The Great Dreamer<BR>filters the Veil<BR>into reality.<BR>Dreams go through Him.
He is the gnawing sensation<BR>at the back of your mind,<BR>driving you towards unholy acts.<BR>You can't escape.
City builders, aeons old.<BR>Even the greatest civilization<BR>is no match to Time.
