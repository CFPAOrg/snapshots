Craft a Sacrificial Altar Core.
Coral Staff
In their unholy penitence, undead seek life.<BR>However, they're imbeciles.<BR>It shouldn't be a difficult task to redirect them from one beating heart to the next, their "minds" fooled by what seems better flesh.<BR>I *know* the exact tool I need.
How bizarre it is that the corals of the deep look so similar to our own arteries.<BR>No coincidence, I am certain. The link between the two is strong.<BR>And it is through this very staff that I may bind hearts together. Interacting with a placed heart while sneaking will store its position in the staff. Once done, interacting while sneaking with another heart (within no more than 32 blocks of distance) will bind the old one's position to this new one's. Any undead that are attracted to the first will then be redirected to the second, which may be also linked to yet another heart, resulting in a true procession of the damned.<BR>If the staff stores a position, it may be cleared by using it while sneaking on the very same heart it was taken from, or while aiming in the air. Using the staff without sneaking will give info on itself or on a clicked heart.<BR>There is, in truth, another use to the staff: attacking an enemy with it will result in nearby undead targeting it, in their endless pursuit of blood and life.

Blood Well
If the undead's desire for blood is so great, then I shall answer to that desire as best as I may.<BR>I shall cover them with the sweet, red substance.<BR>I will build a well that will hoard such undead, bind them to me, so that I may rule them.<BR>A simple structure of blood bricks. The heart must be placed last.
The Well still beats. The dead are drawn towards it, even more so than to normal hearts.<BR>Once they enter the Well, the dead are gone, stored in it. Or, rather, through it.<BR>Blood Sigils can be made for both Zombies and Skeletons. When these undead enter the Well they can later be reacquired through the use of Sigils by using these on the central block of the Well. The Sigils can then be used on the ground to summon my own Blood Undead.<BR>Sigils can be emptied in the Well by sneaking. Summoned Blood Undead can be put back in the Sigil by using it upon them.<BR>I do not know how the Well stores the dead. I imagine it could be a link to some other location, in or out of this world. I truly wish I could enter it myself.<BR>Alas, I am not dead as of yet.
