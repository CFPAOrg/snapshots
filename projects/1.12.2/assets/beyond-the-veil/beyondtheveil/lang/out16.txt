Memories
Make a Memory of Learning.
A new, faint Memory arose from my last Dream.<BR>A Memory of Learning, yet one so faint it could very well not belong to me.<BR>I must exploit it nonetheless. How easily, after all, can Dreams be influenced from the Memories of everyday experiences?<BR>Ah, but I know something very few others do. A Memory can be bottled. Through a Memory Sieve.<BR>A stone basin filled with water, atop of which I will first place an item that could trigger the Memory, then use a memory phial.<BR>In this case, it is a ghast tear that triggers the Memory, though I do not see any possible correlation.<BR>As a side note, where did this knowledge suddenly come from, if not from a memory? Oh, the irony!
I now hold in my hands a collection - or, rather, a recollection - of Learning.<BR>I must Dream under its influence, and to that end I must make a Fume Spreader. A small glass orb that must be placed close to my bed. I must then fill it with Oniric Incense, and only then apply the Memory.<BR>I will then sleep, and the depletion of the Incense will indicate success.<BR>A Memory of Learning, out of any Memory, should indicate me new roads to take.<BR>It has to, for otherwise I'd have no direction left, nowhere to go to.<BR>If this experiment is a failure, then so am I.
Plunging Down
Dreams exist. They are entities, they leave my body, and disappear from my three-dimensional, solid world in a few brief moments, to go where nothing can follow them.<BR>Yet in these few, brief moments.. they go down. Straight down, plunging through stone and bedrock faster than one's eye could follow them. <BR>I feel it. I know it.<BR>I Learned it. <PAGE>I should take at least some advantage of this. For those brief moments I should be able to know more of the soil beneath me. Though a Memory of Learning just won't do this time, I need a different one.<BR>When I mined my first iron ore. Now that's a Memory! Ecstatic I was, as I felt true wealth trickle in my hands!<BR>Heh.. yes, that might cut it.
