Dreams of Water
A Dream of Water, as the thought of the Ocean refuses to leave my mind.<BR>Through this Memory I am able to locate the nearest Ocean Monument.<BR>The Guardians are born from water itself, and as such are closest to God.
Dream Focus
Dream Foci are devices that, through their quartz structure and watery surface, can channel Dreams to move objects.<BR>Not my Dreams. Nor those of Weepers, who yet resist the final embrace.<BR>It is those of Fleti that I must harness, so lost in their desperate adoration of what lies Beyond.
A Dream Focus is a wondrous device.<BR>Its small end should be adjacent to the container I wish to pull items from. It can then be activated by placing a Fletum on its top.<BR>However, I must first choose the path the items will take, and I must do it myself.<BR>When no Fletum is on top of the Dream Focus, I can interact with the block with bare hands. I will then be transported to the large end of the Focus, facing away from it, and start to slowly move wherever I am looking, including in the air. This status lasts fifteen seconds, but I can exit it sooner by sneaking.<BR>Once all is done, the path is set. I can check the path at any time by wearing a Ring of Revelation with its passive effect enabled. I can toggle an individual path on and off by using a clay ball on its respective Focus. I may also apply dyes to the Dream Focus to change the path's color.<BR>With the path set, and a Fletum on top, the Focus will pull items from the container every seven and a half seconds. They will start to float in the air following the path I set, and drop on the path's end. All physics will still apply, and sharp turns around block edges may get the items stuck, so I must be careful when creating the path.<BR>The items can be picked up while in the air, by Players and hoppers alike. A careful combination of pathing and hoppers will result in a proper transportation system.<BR>The Focus can be turned off with a redstone signal.<BR>It also seems that floating swords and blackjacks retain their properties while flying through non Player creatures.<BR>Lastly, Villagers and Weepers in their item forms will be inserted in any Watery Cradle in their path.
