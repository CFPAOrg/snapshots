Craft a Sleep Chamber.
Affecting Myself
So far my Dreams have been able to grant me knowledge, whether it be of arcane secrets and enigmas or of something as simple as the very ground below me. <BR>And yet, I believe... NO! I am CERTAIN that there is more they can do.<BR>Maybe I am not yet capable of having my Dreams affect the world around me, but I can't help but wonder whether there is any way for my Dreams to affect.. me? Not my mind, but my body.. <BR>Sounds impossible, but I am far past that now, am I not?
The way a Memory influences a Dream is quite unpredictable. They're messages, after all, and how I could I fathom the interpretation of such a message from something as bizarre, as alien as.. a Dream?<BR>I will record here those Memories that change the status effects already conditioning my body.
Trigger a Memory capable of affecting myself.
A Memory of Power, as I slay a beast of no small stature. A cherished moment, one of satisfaction.<BR>It is through it that my Dream will increase the potency of the effects on my body.<BR>Both positive and negative ones, that is.
A Memory of Stillness, as the Sleep Chamber imprisons me time and time again.<BR>The effects on my body, I won't let them leave me. Through this Memory, my Dream will increase their durations. All of them.<BR>They cannot escape. No one can.
A Memory of Change, as I witness a sapling grow into adulthood. Such a small thing, even in its now great size.<BR>Even in Stillness, all things Change. Through this Memory, my Dream will remove the negative effects plaguing my body, and even attempt to convert them into their good counterpart.<BR>A powerful Memory, triggered by such a mundane even. As Truth draws closer, I witness the world in a new light.
Dreams of Others
Sometimes, when Dreaming, I get a bizarre feeling.<BR>People like me, even ones I have never known, start appearing in my thoughts. And yet, I feel like it's not a mere construct of my mind, of my subconscious.<BR>No. I think that our Dreams converge within the same point, that they touch each other, and that those presences within my thoughts are REAL.<BR>I believe that, through my "Dreaming expertise", I could know more about those others, that I could probe their Dreams while they remain unaware.<BR>I should take advantage of this. I could try to give birth to a new Memory, one that has a social interaction at its core, so as to point my Dream in the direction of others.<BR>Maybe initiating a simple trade with a villager could work?
