My Dreams have become stronger, I know it, I know it I know it I KNOW IT.<BR>He heard me, The Great Dreamer HEARD MY CALLS.<BR>I realize now that to worship The Great Dreamer is not just an occasional prayer. It is, instead, a way of life.<BR>From now on, our course of action should be to eat slugs, slugs, and even more slugs. They'll start to taste less and less awful, I am certain.<BR>I must also get closer and closer to the Dwellers, and learn from them. Do deeds which make me more like them. They have known best for generations, after all. And my ancestors couldn't see it.<BR>Once all is done, I must interact with the Idol.
Eat 20 slugs, interact with Idol.
Fishermen
First, I'll record here the correct steps for a successful manual use of the bait.<BR>The slug bait must be placed in water. There must be no water on top of it, but it must be surrounded by water on its 4 sides. For best performance it should be in the center of an 11x11 square of water.<BR>If the requirements are met, and I am able to see the faintest of particles, I should soon see the watery essence of the slugs on the water surface. They seemingly appear from nothingness, and pop back out of existence in a few moments. I must aim carefully my slug catcher at them, and use it.<PAGE>Secondly, I am loathe to realize that this manual task will, in the long run, become a bore. The grey robed fishermen in the Hamlet however seem well versed in the art of slug catching.<BR>I can thus employ them to my needs. Interacting with them with a gold ingot in hand will make them follow me, and I'll be able to bring them near to a slug bait, then maybe give them a small nudge to get them on top of it.<BR>Once on the bait, I must ensure they get a steady supply of gold ingots. For each one they get, they'll fish for a minute. The slugs will be dropped on the ground, or get put in a chest adjacent to the Dweller.<BR>I might want to build around them so they do not leave their position.
