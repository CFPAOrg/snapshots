Craft a Charm of Azacno.
Worship
Those worthless wretches, the spineless Villagers, need not be turned into Fleti to be of use.<BR>Bound to the ground as they are, they may think themselves helpless and useless. Fool's worries, I say! All they need is a guide.<BR>Or, rather, a God.<BR>I will gladly lend myself to the cause.<BR>A symbol is needed. Say, a Statue.<BR>Then, a link. My blood will do.<BR>Blood makes for powerful binding, after all.
How pretty. It depicts me as I pray and appease my own God.<BR>I must set an example for my followers, don't I?<BR>The Statue must be placed, then surrounded with crawling Villagers, their spines ripped and their wills broken.<BR>Of course, I must also make sure they don't flee from duty. They are to be imprisoned.<BR>Lastly, I need to cut myself on the Statue, to link it to me. It is an act of self sacrifice.<BR>I must set an example, after all.
I feel them. Their prayers.<BR>This must be what it's like to be a GOD.<BR>They leave me strengthened, my powers invigorated.<BR>For instance, more Deep Ones can be summoned through my pact with Dagon.<BR>It takes less time for me to recover from activating Powers or Baubles. Even Dreams seem to grow stronger.<BR>Only a single Statue can be used at a time, but that is enough.<BR>I, now, am truly godly. I am grand, mighty, I am.. I am..<BR>..do I deserve all this? Or have I sinned of arrogance?
Craft a Statue.
Link a Statue to myself. 
Statue of Sacrifice
Could I seek meaning in selflessness?<BR>To pay myself for someone else's wellbeing? Quite a change from my previous attitudes, and yet, I have followers to take care of now!<BR>I shall build a Statue that portrays me in a very different position, then.
I feel a bit better with myself now, and that's quite something in this journey of hopelessness.<BR>The Statue of Sacrifice does everything the normal Statue does, though it takes slighty more crawlers to achieve the same power.<BR>However, when I'm under its effects, I can use the Sacrificial Altar by using a Sacrificial Knife upon it, instead of sacrificing a Villager, and holding the stack in my other hand instead of dropping it on the ground.<BR>Additionally, every time I take damage all my nearby combat minions (such as summoned Deep Ones, and the like) are strengthened and healed.<BR>Lastly, my patients in the Watery Cradle seem truly inspired by my acts. So much so, that they follow in my footsteps of sacrifice and at times choose to relinquish two hearts, instead of one! However that may be possible.<BR>An example, that's what I must be! Even if it means pain!<BR>After all, I do deserve some Penitence.
