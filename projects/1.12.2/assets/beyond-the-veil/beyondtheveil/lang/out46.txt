Craft a Dream Focus for Villagers.
Surgeon
A net of Dreams links all those who peeked into the Truth.<BR>Entire societes exist away from me, some of these offering their services to allies and patrons.<BR>My alliance with Dagon brings new contacts, and among these come the Surgeons, offering their skills to those who seek them.<BR>I must craft a letter, a summons of sorts, for a Surgeon to reach me.<BR>I then only need use it on the ground. I'll do it once, then sort the Surgeon's job's details later, once I've taken a look at him.
I had wondered why Surgeons would ever form a society of their own.<BR>Little did I know that a Surgeon is not a profession.<BR>No, it is a race.<BR>One that does not belong to my world.<BR>Is this a race made with intent? After all, they all share a singular purpose.<BR>...<BR>What if I, too, were part of a breed that was *made*, not by chance but by will? Without knowing, for how I could I?<BR>A Surgeon is a useful servant, or rather, ally.<BR>I must place him close to a Watery Cradle with which I want him, her, it, whatever, to work.<BR>I must then use Surgery Tools on him to specify which action I want performed.<BR>The Surgeon will then operate every time a patient appears in the Cradle, placing the resulting patient on top of the device and keeping hearts or spines to himself. I can then interact with him with bare hands to be given all materials he gathered.<BR>A much more useful technique however is that of binding the Summons to a nearby chest before using it. To do that I can interact with a chest, wielding the letter, while sneaking.<BR>I can clear the previous binding by right clicking in the air while sneaking.<BR>A Surgeon summoned with a bound Summons will put any output of his operations, both patients and materials, in the bound chest, provided they're sufficiently close to each other.<BR>Since Villagers and Weepers in item form can enter Cradles as well, I can effectively pipeline Surgeons one after the other.<BR>A Surgeon can be picked up by its master with a blackjack.
