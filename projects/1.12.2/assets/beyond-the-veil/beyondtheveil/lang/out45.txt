Craft a Dream Focus for fluids.
Dream Focus: Villagers
My soon-to-be patients, whom I already stripped of all worldly things, seem content in knowing they have nothing more to lose.<BR>Those poor, poor things.<BR>I will take even the floor away from them.
A Focus for Villagers is capable of moving Villagers in a path of my own choosing.<BR>The path begins from the block's top, by interacting with bare hands while no Fletum is activating the Focus. I will preserve my initial rotation after interacting with the block.<BR>Once the path is set, a Fletum must be placed below the Focus. Once that is done, the device will select every few seconds a Villager to move.<BR>The Villagers are taken from a 11x11 area centered on the Focus, up to 5 blocks above it. Crawling Villagers take precedence and are chosen before any standing ones. Child Villagers won't be taken, they must grow before reaching any usefulness.<BR>A redstone signal may be applied to the Focus to alter its functionality. A fully powered signal will disable the device altogether. A signal of strength between 1 and 14 instead determines how many adult standing Villagers will be left at all times in the area above.<BR>For example, with a signal of strength 3 and 2 standing Villagers above, none will be taken. This way their mating and reproduction is ensured.<BR>Crawling Villagers are exempt from this check, and will always be taken.<BR>If the Focus' path is aimed at a Watery Cradle, a floating Crawling Villager will automatically be placed in it if there are no patients already present. Of course, I must make sure to loop the path back to the Focus in case the Cradle wasn't empty.<BR>This is especially useful considering that a Blackjack floating through a Dream Focus for items will preserve its properties, and may even knockout Villagers while both item and victim are mid air.<BR>Of course, were I to fully automate surgery.. I'd need a Surgeon.
