Dream of Flora with a diamond in hand.
Vijhiss
My next Flora Dream should be made with a block of obsidian in my hand.<BR>I *know* something is going to happen.
This plant is somewhat unsettling.<BR>Not only because of its appearance, betraying no sense of belonging to this world.<BR>No, this plant is greedy.<BR>In the most literal sense, in fact!<BR>Vijhiss wants and accepts gold. Ingots fashioned from the noble yellow metal will solicit a reward from the plant.<BR>Vijhiss is capable of granting me numerous kinds of seeds, some from this world and some not, some that I have seen already and some entirely new.<BR>My only worry lies in the faint sense of glee that the plant emanates at every trade.
Dream of Flora with obsidian in hand.
Megydrea
Should I encourage the avid nature of Vijhiss?<BR>I don't trust that plant, yet the boons may be worth it.<BR>I'll try and give it a bigger piece of gold.
A new plant, granted to me by Vijhiss. I can obtain more of its kind by giving more gold blocks to that greedy weed.<BR>The Megydrea acts as a fluid tank. It is placed on the ceiling and hangs from there, two blocks tall.<BR>Up to forty buckets of any fluid can be stored.
Give Vijhiss a gold block.
Dreams of Beheading
A Memory of Beheading, as I cut off a wither skull.<BR>The thought is macabre, yet the death is quick and painless.<BR>Such a Memory can be used to gain my own head. Not a copy, I can swear it breathed up to mere moments ago.<BR>If used on the Dream Shrine while targeted towards a certain Player, it can be instead used to gain that Player's head.<BR>Do these heads not belong to this world? Or even this time?
Dreams of Heartbreak
A Memory of Heartbreak, as I lose a loyal friend.<BR>Slowly, sorrow is replaced with anger. Towards those who don't feel my pain, closed in their own cynicism.<BR>A tinge of hypocrisy there?<BR>Shush.<BR>A Memory of Heartbreak makes for a far more offensive Dream than most. When used all non Player creatures within a fairly large distance, as well as I, remain afflicted for a limited time. Our health will be lowered until the effect ends, and a proper combination with Memories of Power and of Stillness makes for an extremely powerful weapon.<BR>Of course, hurting myself in the process is not ideal. With the Dream Shrine, I can properly target specific locations to afflict all the non Player creatures in a 30 block radius centered on the Sigil's location without being penalized for it.<BR>And, of course, I may also target specific Players.<BR>Everyone's had dark periods in their life. I must only make them reminisce.
