Dream of Flora.
Grass Seeds
The Flora Dream granted me a new kind of crop.<BR>These grass seeds are meant to be cultivated like normal wheat by placing them on tilled soil.<BR>The difference stands in the seeds themselves being the actual crop.<BR>Indeed, when used upon normal dirt these seeds are capable of covering it with lush grass. They are expended in the act, however.<BR>This first bunch of seeds should be used immediately on tilled soil to gain more of their kind, as I do not know whether further Flora Dreams will grant me the same type of seed.
Redstone Seeds
These seeds are more special than their grass counterpart.<BR>They are cultivated in the same way, yet these have different effects when utilized.<BR>They can be used upon both dirt and grass. When that happens, the grass is converted into Redstone Grass, a mimic type of block that looks exactly like normal grass, but produces a redstone signal when an entity stands upon it.<BR>An invisible trap, to catch unwanted intruders.
Ghost Seeds
These seeds are extremely light. They feel almost like air in my very own hands.<BR>They can be cultivated on tilled soil like the other two types of seeds.<BR>However, when used upon dirt or grass these seeds will transform that block into ghost grass, an ethereal block that is insubstantial on touch, but looks exactly like grass to the eye. Perfect for pitfalls and the like.<BR>Only now, however, do I reflect on the weirdness of these finds. These seeds are too bizarre to belong to this world.<BR>So where does the Dream go to pluck such treasures?
Arboreal Generator
Next time I Dream of Flora, I shall hold a diamond in my hand. Then something will happen.<BR>How do I know this? Well, it's that that I do not know.
This small, pretty tree is known as an Arboreal Generator.<BR>It is a useful plant, that slowly generates saplings on each of its four sides.<BR>It first creates small shrubs. These emit an extremely faint redstone signal, which might come in useful.<BR>These shrubs are then turned into saplings of various kinds.<BR>This plant does not belong to this world, I am certain.
