Crucible
A weapon with a red hot blade, used by demon slayers in ages long past.<BR>One man armies they were, more terrible than any of their enemies.<BR>The Crucible is immensely powerful, capable of dishing out colossal damage for every hit.<BR>It is, however, balanced by the fact that for every swing the weapon needs around two minutes of recharging before it can be used again. And of course, many enemies of mine may not suffer too much damage in a single hit, so I must use it wisely.
Baubles
Some items are to be worn outside of my armor slots.<BR>The Baubles I encounter in this journey (and only this journey) may have both active and passive effects.<BR>By holding the Bauble key ('Z' by default) I can choose which Baubles must have their passive effect enabled and which single Bauble is to be the active one.<BR>There can be only one active Bauble, and its effect can be activated by tapping the Bauble Key.
Dreams of Introspection
A Memory of Introspection, as I reflect upon my own self while I walk among my worshippers.<BR>Through this Memory I can know more of the power I've obtained in my journey.<BR>Of course, were I to target someone else with the Dream I may also scry into their secrets.
Roaring
While transformed I am unable to use the active effects of my Baubles, as well as to open the Bauble Powers menu.<BR>In that form, however, I am instead able to release a blood curdling roar that will affect all entities around me with Terror, by tapping the same key I'd have used for the Active Bauble.<BR>To strike fear in my opponents' hearts is to be closer than ever to God.
To New Depths
We must keep going.<BR>Never yield, the Truth draws close, the Veil weakens, my knowledge grows, my will..<BR>What will is left? As if someone ripped my own spine.<BR>No, we'll keep going. We must.<BR>To the bottom of the deepest Oceans.<BR>To Arche, and then to Apeiron.<BR>Our journey won't end until we breach.. until we..<BR>..wait..<BR>..who's 'we'?
