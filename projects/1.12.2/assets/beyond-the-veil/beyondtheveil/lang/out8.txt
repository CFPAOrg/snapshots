Trust me,[ outsider.:They have every right to.] :After what your ancestors did, outsiders are not liked here.|  :But you don't know what I'm talking about, right?
It's unsettling.:Especially that bizarre sculpture:in the center.
That's the idol of our very own[ God.]| :The deity we chose to believe in, in the shape we saw fit to portray him with.| :I won't criticise you for finding its appearance unsettling.
But if that unsettling feeling were to be replaced with fear and hatred for us and our customs,| then you're no different from your ancestors.
You don't know what I'm referring to, right?
Are you a{ true seeker of knowledge?}:Could you truly be interested in learning more of our past?
I doubt it. Your mind has yet to open.
I.. I do sense within you a{ thirst..}:A certain lust for learning.| A kind of curiousness, a foolish but{ fascinating one.
Do you wish to know more of our history? Of all the{ suffering} we've endured?
Do you wish to know more of what your ancestors did to us, in their fear of the[ unknown?
Tell me more.:I wish to know.
It is refreshing to see one of you seek this knowledge instead of fleeing it. |:Although, of course.. |I must warn you. |{:Knowledge is fear.
The more you know, |the more you see, |the{ blinder you are,} |once you realise what Veil of illusions is clouding your mind. |:An{ unbreachable] Veil. | Trust me,{ I tried}. To no avail.
Keep your lies:to yourself,:fiend.
Why,{ you truly are no different from your ancestors...} are you? |:You just think us monsters, right? Twisted, contorted beings engaging in unholy customs?
And what is it that drives such thoughts, if you don't mind me asking?:Is it our pale, ghastly skin? Or is it that bizarre sculpture in the central square?
It is exactly:those things:you're talking about.:You are inhuman.
That |is true.:But what is it that drives humans to[ slaughter] all that resembles them yet isn't truly like them? | :And{ declare themselves SAINTS in the process?
