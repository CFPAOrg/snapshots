ALL LIFE IS BORN FROM WATER
THROUGH BLOOD THEY ARE LINKED TO THE DEEP
YOUR LINK GROWS EVER STRONGER
YOU MUST BATHE IN THE LAND OF ENDERMEN
ENGULFED IN THE VOID AND CLOSEST TO GOD
THERE YOU WILL DREAM WHILE IN WATER
AND THE OCEANS WILL BE YOURS
We must bathe in the End, and there we must Dream.
SLAY THE LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER
HIS DEATH WON'T MATTER
PROVE HIS WORTHLESSNESS
AND I WILL GRANT YOU SOME TRUTH
A necessary murder. Should I listen to his last words?
HE WAS IRRELEVANT
AND SO ARE YOU
YOUR DEATH WILL COME IN ITS OWN TIME
SEEK WORTH IN PRAYER
GOD WILL NOT LISTEN
