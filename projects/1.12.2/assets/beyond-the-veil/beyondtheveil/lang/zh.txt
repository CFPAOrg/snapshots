§5§oThe sensation I get by touching, seeing or even thinking of this flute is truly bizarre. It's as if it does not exist in my world.. and yet it's there, in my hands.
§5§oThis weapon.. this bizarre metal contraption, is a masterwork of engineering. Capable of effortlessly switching between its normal and extended form, it also enables its wielder to dodge in the same style of its ancient owners.
§5§oThis metal artifact gives a soft hum whenever close to monsters, alerting its wearer to their presence. It was no doubt used by hunters in eras long past.
§5§oNo no no, this isn't possible, this simply can't be. I KNOW this sphere. I KNOW I've held it. I just.. don't remember it. It must've been in the hamlet where I found it for aeons, by now?
§5§oA weapon wielded by demon slayers of yore. Immensely powerful, but needs a long recharge after every use.
%1$s experience currently stashed.
§5§oAn ancient stony slab with weird inscriptions on it. Can I decipher it?
§5§oWillpower resides in the spine.
§5§oA set of tools used for surgery. Somewhat rusty, but I am certain my patients won't mind.
§5§oA villager lacking his dorsal spine. He'll never get up.
§5§oAn unconscious villager, ready for experimentation.
§5§oA villager without a heart. Soon, he will expire.
§5§oBoth the spine and the heart were ripped out of this villager. Truly, a worthless wretch.
§5§oA Weeper without its spine is nothing but its head.
§5§oAn abomination.
§5§oOne does not need a heart to weep. It will survive just fine.
§5§oA Weeper without its spine is nothing but its head.
§5§oA disembodied head, content in its sorrow.
§5§oIt sleeps. Don't awaken it. Please.

§5§oThrough Dagon, The Great Dreamer blesses us once more.
§5§oLeave us alone, outsider.
§5§oBegone. We don't want you here.
§5§oOutsiders are not welcome here.
§5§oPlease, please stop coming after us.
§5§oHmph. 
§5§oYou did well to join us.
§5§oBeing a fisherman isn't hard here, the fish just come to us.
§5§oDon't like the slugs? You'll soon appreciate them.
§5§oYou are no friend of ours, outsider. No one is.
§5§oWe can't trust you outsiders. No more.
§5§oPlease, please leave us BE.
§5§oI was mistaken to think ill of you, outsider.
§5§oTruly, we deem you a friend now.
§5§oFeel free to take anything from the storehouse.
A newcomer, aye? We dun't see many aoutsiders no'adays.
I ain't frum around here, fella. Me pa' an' me ma' was frum this Hamlet, aye, but me, I was bo'n an' rais'd elsewhar.
I dun't like life here. I dun't like life no more.
Hey, buy me a drink, will ye?
None too shabby, that rum -hic- pardon.
Aye, my 'friends' araound here ain't no fun to chat with. They's got.. secrets to hide.
Huh? No, I dunno anythin'.
Hey, wud ye get me 'nother drink, pal?
Hmm, thar's the gud stuff -hic- excuse me.
We may be isolat'd, but we got gold aplenty! We ain't poor! Well, per'haps I am.
Huh, the gold? It comes.. it comes frum below, aye, frum below.
Hey, off'r me 'nother round, bud!
§oAhhh, ain't that tasty -hic- forgive me.
§oWhen me was a y'ung lad, me pa' told me tales o' the sea an' its dwellars. Ye know, thar's things down thar..
§oThings.. horrid, indescribable things..
§oI'm thi'sty. Got some more coin on ye?
§oHmm mhh, hadn't had this good'a drink in years -hic- my bad.
§oAye, horrid things.. and me mates here.. they adore 'em. Trade with 'em. Some e'en mate with 'em.
§oAnd then they dream...
§oHey, I 'now I shudn't be askin', but.. y'know the drill. Fetch me a drink.
§oAh, mebbe I'm havin' too much -hic- apologies.
§oThe.. things, they gav' us fish.. an' gold! But not fur nuthin', nuh huh.
§oI ain't never killed nobody, no, but my mates.. eh.

{Hmph. }We don't appreciate outsiders coming here, but if you really need to, I won't deny you a single night's rest. There are beds up above.
Don't mind the one in the red suit. He's a drunken fool, and spits out lies like no tomorrow.
Hey, there are beds up above if you need some rest.
Want a drink? Just ask. First one's on the house.
Thanks:I'll take it.
Not now,:thanks.
There you go, finest quality rum you'll find.
Enjoy your stay.
{Hmm, hmm. }:Greetings.
Got n'thing to say to ye.
Wanna buy an'thing?
Wanna buy an'th[... | :... | :...]| ask.
How do:you fish?
Me? I don't fish. |:Me mates, they use me canoes.
What're the:canoes for?
Me fisher mates use 'em to.. fish. In the ocean.
An easy job theirs. The Ones from the Deep just give 'em fish.
You buying my stuff or no?
Oh. |{A traveller}[... ] :Welcome.
I imagine you stumbled upon our Hamlet by chance, in your endless travels.:I can only envy you, stuck as I am,{ watching this lighthouse.
I am left to wonder, though, what does an explorer like you think of our humble Hamlet? |Out of[ all] the beauties you must've admired, what impression does it leave upon you?
It strikes me:with a peculiar sense:of awe.
I do not like it.:There's an atmosphere:of hostility here.
{Ohh,} such a pleasure to hear it. Tell me then, traveller,:what is it that{ awes} you in such a{ peculiar} way?
The unique architecture,:how everything fits:upon the water on which it's built.
{Ahh, yes.}:We're very proud of what we've built.|| :And rebuilt. |  :And rebuilt over and over again, just for it to be[ burnt down.
You have no idea of what I'm referring to, right?:In your pursuit of knowledge of the world, you have ignored that of history.
The rare items I find here.:The loot.
Ah, not just a traveller, but a looter!:What items interest you the most?
The ancient artifacts.
Those artifacts aren't ours. Well, at least they weren't.:They were brought to us by friends, who took them from foes. |:You don't know what I'm referring to, right?
The slugs.
HA! |THE SLUGS! |Well, don't eat those! |:[You might regret it.
You can't[ even begin] to imagine how important those slimy creatures are to us.:They are our means of communion, with the God we chose to believe in.
Find that strange? Well, you should.:But if that{ "strangeness"} fills you with fear and hatred for us and our customs,| then you're no different from your ancestors.
You don't know what I'm referring to, right?
That doesn't surprise me,{ outsider}.:What is it you do not like?
The dwellers.:They seem to despise outsiders.
Trust me,[ outsider.:They have every right to.] :After what your ancestors did, outsiders are not liked here.|  :But you don't know what I'm talking about, right?
It's unsettling.:Especially that bizarre sculpture:in the center.
That's the idol of our very own[ God.]| :The deity we chose to believe in, in the shape we saw fit to portray him with.| :I won't criticise you for finding its appearance unsettling.
But if that unsettling feeling were to be replaced with fear and hatred for us and our customs,| then you're no different from your ancestors.
You don't know what I'm referring to, right?
Are you a{ true seeker of knowledge?}:Could you truly be interested in learning more of our past?
I doubt it. Your mind has yet to open.
I.. I do sense within you a{ thirst..}:A certain lust for learning.| A kind of curiousness, a foolish but{ fascinating one.
Do you wish to know more of our history? Of all the{ suffering} we've endured?
Do you wish to know more of what your ancestors did to us, in their fear of the[ unknown?
Tell me more.:I wish to know.
It is refreshing to see one of you seek this knowledge instead of fleeing it. |:Although, of course.. |I must warn you. |{:Knowledge is fear.
The more you know, |the more you see, |the{ blinder you are,} |once you realise what Veil of illusions is clouding your mind. |:An{ unbreachable] Veil. | Trust me,{ I tried}. To no avail.
Keep your lies:to yourself,:fiend.
Why,{ you truly are no different from your ancestors...} are you? |:You just think us monsters, right? Twisted, contorted beings engaging in unholy customs?
And what is it that drives such thoughts, if you don't mind me asking?:Is it our pale, ghastly skin? Or is it that bizarre sculpture in the central square?
It is exactly:those things:you're talking about.:You are inhuman.
That |is true.:But what is it that drives humans to[ slaughter] all that resembles them yet isn't truly like them? | :And{ declare themselves SAINTS in the process?
Ignorance. |Yes, maybe that is it. | :Without knowledge, you make assumptions.[ Dangerous ones.
Why don't you relieve yourself of your prejudice, outsider, and let me tell you how things truly went?
All of you just:dismissed me with the:very same prejudice you:are now accusing me of.
...truth is, outsider..  we are afraid. |:Terribly afraid of ones like you. Ours isn't prejudice as much as it is wariness, justified suspiciousness.
If you truly want to fight prejudice, then why don't you listen to me, and let me tell how things truly went?
So, traveller, what'll it be? Will you listen now to our story?
Fine.:Go ahead.
Not now.
There are many Hamlets like ours in this world, although not as many as there once were. But they've all got something in common.
You may have been turned off initially by the blackness and dampness of the surrounding territory, but everytime you see it, it means that at one point in time a Hamlet like ours stood there.
The ground wasn't always like this, though. :Contrary to what some may think, we didn't settle here because of any appeal the soil had upon us. :In fact, we are the very reason the ground became so.
It was our worship of our Deity that made it happen, and if that doesn't prove its realness, then I don't know what will.:Unfortunately, many of[ your ancestors] did not like the idea of a god truer than theirs.
In fact they were so disgusted at the idea of a deity turning the ground black and damp that they deemed us 'heretics', and started hunting us down.[ One by one.]
{Our homes were burned, our people slaughtered.} Our fathers, the survivors, lost everything. It was a{ massacre.}{ It was a[ GENOCIDE].
And they deemed themselves "Saints" and "Hunters", those{ merciless murderers.
But we had friends. Powerful friends, who pulled the war away from us, and upon themselves. Oh, and if it wasn't for them, our whole people would've been{ eradicated.
Nobody won in those times. And all of it for{ your ancestors'} disdain for that which is different. For the dark sand below us, and the weird shape of our Deity.
Do you understand now why my fellow dwellers, as well as I, have such disdain for outsiders? Why we are so wary of them?
Who are these:'friends' you:spoke of?
I understand.:You have my sympathies.
That is none of your concern, for as long as you remain an outsider.:But that doesn't have to stay like that.
And you have my gratitude. For listening to my tale, our history.:For relieving me of the burden of knowledge.
Should you need to know more, ask.
You are a Dreamer. I know that. |:You seek Truth. I know that too.
You wish to breach the Veil. To venture Beyond it. |:Well, you already did, if only in Dream, unable to recall anything.
You now desperately try to convince yourself that you can do it. Succeed where all have failed. Ridding yourself of lies.
Help me.
I AM SICK:OF LIES.
We all are, until we realise how much worse the Truth is. ||:I will help you.
That statue, in the central square, it represents our marine Deity. |:The Great Dreamer.
You seek the Truth, The Great Dreamer hides it. |:To speak with Him, is to go{ Beyond the Veil.
Traveller, all Dreams go through water. Through The Great Dreamer. |:Look at the Ocean.
[Oh my.] |:You communed.
The slugs. Eat them. Even if they hurt.
I am impressed traveller. Truly. |:I am impressed by your resolve, your strength of will, your determination in your quest for knowledge, as dangerous as it may be.
I am impressed by your open mind, realising the misdeeds of your ancestors and disavowing them. |:And most of all, I am impressed at how wholly you pledge yourself to your new belief.
Be wary of disappointment. Sooner or later, it'll come. It'll sting.
For now, get on a canoe and sail. Talk to a carpenter.
But now, it's time you take the next step. 
We Dwellers can't breathe water from the moment we're born. No, it comes later.
It is only through endless devotion to The Great Dreamer that an outsider such as you may be granted this Gift. :To us it's different. Genetic. I won't mention the details.
But ultimately, for both of our kinds it is only through an act of faith that we may be granted the Gift. |:You must drown.
There is a ritual that must be made. I could explain it to you, yet I am certain that that voice in your head will take care of it.
I still remember when I underwent the ritual. You will too.
I was under the water, I couldn't breathe, I was going to die, I knew I was and I regretted it, I regretted everything and I couldn't breathe and they had lied to me and they had left me to drown and I had to believe but I couldn't and I was dying and I BREATHE. :In. And out. In. And out. Again. And again.
That was my Baptism. Soon, you shall have yours.
Good luck, friend.
Ah, I Dreamt of you tonight. You wish to tell me something.
The drunken one:told me:everything.
Have you:always been:victims?
And you would trust the words of an old, insane drunken fool? |:Why, of course you should. You'll find that insanity brings one closer to Truth, for better or worse.
The drunken one appeared in my Dream as well. :It was him who told you something, wasn't he?
From his words, an old Truth arises. :MY ancestors' traditions went too far at times. Sacrifices, murders, experiments.
Blood lays in the black sand beneath us. They did it for power, through unholy pacts. The Great Dreamer, or rather, his ArchPriest, demanded payment.
You didn't need this Truth. It would've only dissuaded you from your goal. :You see? I had to hide it.  My own Veil, of sorts.
That, however, does not excuse in the slightest that which happened to us. :No sin is great enough to justify GENOCIDE.
You did wrong.:Punishment was:due.
Your actions did:not deserve such:punishment.
There is no right answer. :But know that I{ despise} those who think the way you do.
That is what we think as well. :Yet your forefathers knew better, it seems.
It matters not. Let the past stay past, we are not the ones who may walk through time. Only speak.
Granting me a few last words? |Thank you, traveller. :I'll make it quick.
Let's start from an objective Truth. A mathematical one. :The greatest number you could ever think of is nothing to infinity.
Another Truth. I am insignificant. :There are countless others exactly like me in this very world. Exact copies. :I am just a bunch of ifs and fors, so irrelevant that you would mete out my death with barely any hesitation.
My question, outsider, is this. :Do you really claim a mind of infinite complexity? I am sorry to say but, that's not the way it is. Billions upon billions of synapses, yet, sooner or later, even your mind could be copied. Just like mine.
That is a snippet of Truth, outsider, just for you. Your life is worth naught.
It does not matter what world you come from, the Truth spans all realms. | :Because it lies Beyond The Veil, in the region between all universes.
Go ahead, strike me down. My death won't matter. || :And neither will yours.
Oh my! A traveller! |:Hello! Hi! Greetings! Welcome! Salutations!
I am this Hamlet's Scholar! A rare profession nowadays. :Haha. Most of us are dead.
No worries though. Thou art a friend, ain't ya? |:Feel free to browse the Town Hall.
See thee later, dude.
Oi, art thou dabblin' in the art of Weeper making? |:Nice.
Ya know, back in the day we used to make Weepers too. :Then we stopped, since some people didn't like that practice of ours, and in the end we had enough to weep of our own!
Yeah, things were tough back then. :My friends named me Weeper Ad Honorem after me pa and me ma were.. ya know..
We still weep at times, absorbed in recollection. :So please, friend, hearken our chants. :And weep with us.
See thee later, dude.
Oi, dost thou knoweth what a SHOGGOTH is?
Yes, I do. 
Enlighten me. 
Oh. |I'm sorry, really. |:That is not a knowledge borne lightly.
I beg of thee, friend. :Don't trust the Shoggoth. Thou will regret it.
It was that voice in thy head that told ya how to make one, eh?
What voice? 
Yes. 
Oh no I'm not doin' that. :Thou art lucky enough as it is, my dude.
Yet I fear that that voice in thy head will, sooner or later, tell thee how to make one.
What voice? 
Tell me more. 
Remember when ya were baptised and then breathed HARD in a voice that wasn't thine? :Heh.
See thee later, dude.
§5§oWhen I gaze at the horrors before me, all I have left is to weep.
§5§oYou are lucky, master, in your ignorance of what lies Beyond.
§5§oMaster, the water you put in my brain.. it's agonizing, yet the pain is not of physical nature.
§5§oEverything is so meaningless.. you'll see, once you dip your head in water.
§5§oMaster.. I beg of you.. rip my spine. Make me whole.
§5§oI cannot *see* the world around me, yet I *know* it, even better than you do, Master. And it is most horrid.
§5§oYou baptized me Master.. you are holy, a god among worms.
§5§oI hear whispers.. please.. somebody.. stop them...
§5§oI Dreamt of you. You were laughing, but not of joy. Your eyes were hollow.
§5§oThe world is beautiful. Like an Ocean of tears.
§5§oSplish splash. Heehee.
§5§oI am whole.
§5§oI see beautiful shapes.. transparent and fluid, like a watery surface.
§5§oI see a pocket of red at the bottom of the Ocean, like a ruby within a diamond.
§5§oI Dreamt of a beautiful rainbow. It was red.
§5§oMy Dreams colour the world! I am sure, because your face is red, heehee.
§5§oThe Crawling Chaos whispered to me. He said I'm his favourite, heehee!
§5§oMaster! Master! I have a secret that I wish to share!
§5§oMaster.. I can share a terrible, terrible secret with you.
§5§oAll I ask in return is for you to promise to grant me a wish, a single wish. Speak to me again if you accept.
§5§oOh.. Master.. my dear Master. Thank you. The secret has been kept for too long.

I have Dreamt %1$s/%2$s times today.
No effect came from this dream, and yet I still felt a tingling. Maybe it'll work in the future, under different circumstances.
I need more strength.

Beyond the Veil
Dreams
I must sleep. I must Dream.
The last trip I took to the Nether left me with a bizarre feeling. That of plunging down, through stone and bedrock, gods know how far into another realm.<BR>Truly, a bizarre feeling, one that felt to me weirdly.. weirdly..<BR>..nostalgic?<BR>Yes.. a weird nostalgia of an experience I've never lived. A memory that came all of a sudden, when last I dreamt.<BR>A dream. Why, that could indeed be the key!<BR>I must dream once more, I must peer into my own subconscious.  
Dreams are a thing of wonder.<BR>I once though they'd be merely a window into my own subconscious and yet there seems to be so much more to them than meets the eye.<BR>What if the things I saw in Dreams were not fiction, what if they were true?<BR>What if they showed me part of a great Truth invisible to all but a Dreamer?<BR>I must practice the art of Dreaming. I must be the one to uncover this Truth.<BR>I, and only I, must be the one.
Memories
Make a Memory of Learning.
A new, faint Memory arose from my last Dream.<BR>A Memory of Learning, yet one so faint it could very well not belong to me.<BR>I must exploit it nonetheless. How easily, after all, can Dreams be influenced from the Memories of everyday experiences?<BR>Ah, but I know something very few others do. A Memory can be bottled. Through a Memory Sieve.<BR>A stone basin filled with water, atop of which I will first place an item that could trigger the Memory, then use a memory phial.<BR>In this case, it is a ghast tear that triggers the Memory, though I do not see any possible correlation.<BR>As a side note, where did this knowledge suddenly come from, if not from a memory? Oh, the irony!
I now hold in my hands a collection - or, rather, a recollection - of Learning.<BR>I must Dream under its influence, and to that end I must make a Fume Spreader. A small glass orb that must be placed close to my bed. I must then fill it with Oniric Incense, and only then apply the Memory.<BR>I will then sleep, and the depletion of the Incense will indicate success.<BR>A Memory of Learning, out of any Memory, should indicate me new roads to take.<BR>It has to, for otherwise I'd have no direction left, nowhere to go to.<BR>If this experiment is a failure, then so am I.
Plunging Down
Dreams exist. They are entities, they leave my body, and disappear from my three-dimensional, solid world in a few brief moments, to go where nothing can follow them.<BR>Yet in these few, brief moments.. they go down. Straight down, plunging through stone and bedrock faster than one's eye could follow them. <BR>I feel it. I know it.<BR>I Learned it. <PAGE>I should take at least some advantage of this. For those brief moments I should be able to know more of the soil beneath me. Though a Memory of Learning just won't do this time, I need a different one.<BR>When I mined my first iron ore. Now that's a Memory! Ecstatic I was, as I felt true wealth trickle in my hands!<BR>Heh.. yes, that might cut it.
The Dream reacted to my Memory of Metal by granting me knowledge of the presence of metals in the ground below.<BR>It responded to me. It's as if it was... sentient?<BR>It is bizarre, even somewhat unsettling.. and yet, I can't keep myself from wishing to know more, to shatter this facade of illusions clouding my mind from.. from this unknowable Truth.<BR>I'm sure new experiences will trigger new Memories that will grant new knowledge, and maybe other effects.<BR>I must keep going. Whenever I am stuck, it'll be wise to resort to a Memory of Learning.
Very similarly to Metal, a Memory of Crystal grants me knowledge of the earth beneath me, this time teaching me of the presence of crystals, namely diamonds and emeralds.
Dreams may go straight down, yet their knowledge of the world is vast.<BR>And through the making of a simple book, I'm reminded of those who inhabit this world.<BR>A Memory of Sentience, with which I can instruct my Dream to seek a society like that of a Village, and point me to it.
Dream of Metal.
Sleep Chamber
I'd always been proud of my ability to stay awake and work and walk as long as I needed, leaving sleep to times of absolute necessity.<BR>Oh, how ironic that now it is sleep I need, and can't get enough of it.<BR>I must Dream, keep Dreaming, again and again. Once a day, only at night, is not enough, it just isn't. I shall focus my mind on the creation of some device capable of ridding me of that limit, at least partially.<BR>First, a proper crafting station. The Gear Bench will aid me in the creation of more complex objects.
This machine, which I named Sleep Chamber, is most curious. Its construction requires a knowledge of mechanics, biology and chemistry so far outside of my usual scope of knowledge that I would dare to deem it... alien?<BR>And yet it came to me, all of a sudden, not through experimentation, but seemingly by itself.<BR>Oh, I'll enquire on that mistery another time.<BR>The Chamber must be opened, and once I'm inside I must close it to start Dreaming. It is capable of putting me to sleep once per day, and wake me up immediately, without any time going by. And yet this istant is enough for the Dream to leave me and do its task as dictated by a nearby Fume Spreader, just like a normal bed.<BR>It is truly unbelievable, and yet I feel like I only scraped the surface of what this journey could lead me to.<BR>It is merely a stepping stone, to shatter all the fake truths I thought I knew.
Craft a Sleep Chamber.
Affecting Myself
So far my Dreams have been able to grant me knowledge, whether it be of arcane secrets and enigmas or of something as simple as the very ground below me. <BR>And yet, I believe... NO! I am CERTAIN that there is more they can do.<BR>Maybe I am not yet capable of having my Dreams affect the world around me, but I can't help but wonder whether there is any way for my Dreams to affect.. me? Not my mind, but my body.. <BR>Sounds impossible, but I am far past that now, am I not?
The way a Memory influences a Dream is quite unpredictable. They're messages, after all, and how I could I fathom the interpretation of such a message from something as bizarre, as alien as.. a Dream?<BR>I will record here those Memories that change the status effects already conditioning my body.
Trigger a Memory capable of affecting myself.
A Memory of Power, as I slay a beast of no small stature. A cherished moment, one of satisfaction.<BR>It is through it that my Dream will increase the potency of the effects on my body.<BR>Both positive and negative ones, that is.
A Memory of Stillness, as the Sleep Chamber imprisons me time and time again.<BR>The effects on my body, I won't let them leave me. Through this Memory, my Dream will increase their durations. All of them.<BR>They cannot escape. No one can.
A Memory of Change, as I witness a sapling grow into adulthood. Such a small thing, even in its now great size.<BR>Even in Stillness, all things Change. Through this Memory, my Dream will remove the negative effects plaguing my body, and even attempt to convert them into their good counterpart.<BR>A powerful Memory, triggered by such a mundane even. As Truth draws closer, I witness the world in a new light.
Dreams of Others
Sometimes, when Dreaming, I get a bizarre feeling.<BR>People like me, even ones I have never known, start appearing in my thoughts. And yet, I feel like it's not a mere construct of my mind, of my subconscious.<BR>No. I think that our Dreams converge within the same point, that they touch each other, and that those presences within my thoughts are REAL.<BR>I believe that, through my "Dreaming expertise", I could know more about those others, that I could probe their Dreams while they remain unaware.<BR>I should take advantage of this. I could try to give birth to a new Memory, one that has a social interaction at its core, so as to point my Dream in the direction of others.<BR>Maybe initiating a simple trade with a villager could work?
I have reason to believe that, within their own weird, a-dimensional plane of existence, Dreams are all adjacent to each other. To all others. At the same time, at all times.<BR>While their position may shift in relation to our world (such as when they go straight down through bedrock), my Dreams are tangent to all others.<BR>This is a breakthrough discovery. As a Dreamer more expert than most, I can probe the Dreams of others with my Own, learning things about them while ignoring any privacy they think they have. I should keep working on this ability, so that it may reach its full potential.<BR>Still, this new knowledge brings with itself a new fear.<BR>Fear that there could be other Dreamers, greater than myself, and that my excessive forays into Dreaming only made me more vulnerable.<BR>Other Dreamers, that could possibly not even be human.<PAGE>A Memory of Human was triggered by initiating a trade with one of those dim-witted Villagers. Sooner or later, I'll make them pay for their inane prices.<BR>This Memory makes for Dreams of no great consequence, for now. It enables me to know of the position of others like me, but just one of either their x or z coordinates, for a single unnamed human other than myself, provided there is at least one at the time of Dreaming.
Initiate a trade with a Villager, see where it leads.
A Memory of Tools, as I craft a powerful one.<BR>Yet, I burn with envy at the idea of others wielding items mightier than mine.<BR>Through this Memory, I can learn of what item is held in the main hand of a single unnamed human other than myself, provided there is at least one at the time of Dreaming. 
Tablet Inscriptions
These ancient stone tablets can be deciphered.<BR>Their contents may be unsettling, but my pursuit of knowledge won't be stopped by this. I hope.
I've managed to decipher these tablets, but I'm sure there are more. I'll record their content here.<BR>When completed, they can be used to learn new research, just like a Memory of Learning. Just like the Memory, they'll only be consumed if there's something to learn.
Advanced Sleep Chamber
The Sleep Chamber is an extremely useful device, but the progress of research should never stop, it should know no bounds.<BR>New revelations spring to mind on how to make it reach its full potential.
The key was WATER. What this substance has to do with Dreaming I can't yet guess, but its addition in the Sleep Chamber's gears and wirings vastly improved its Dream-aiding capabilities.<BR>This Advanced Sleep Chamber lets me Dream twice as many times per day as the regular one. Not only that, it lets my Dream be influenced by two Fume Spreaders at the same time!<BR>Just think of the combinations!
Craft an Advanced Sleep Chamber.
Dreams of Void
A new Memory springs forth in my mind.<BR>The Void. Black, inscrutable, unknowable. Its essence is burned in my mind, like no Memory before.<BR>Dreams go through THE VOID.<BR>THAT is where they truly depart from the known world to go where nothing can follow them... yet.<BR>I am certain of this.<BR>I need to Dream of the VOID.<BR>Of its black emptiness.<BR>So I may reach it myself.
The Dream was far less flagrant that I imagined.<BR>A Dream of Void doesn't seem to affect me directly.<BR>However, were I to Dream again, after Dreaming of Void (or during, if I have the means to do so) then it seems my Dreaming capabilities are somewhat improved. Not terribly so, and it applies only to a scarce few Memories, but it's something.<BR>And yet, I shouldn't underestimate this Memory's importance.<BR>I believe that its true effect stands in slowing down my next Dream's descent, especially its stay in the Void. And if that is true, then my quest for knowledge might have reached a breakthrough.<BR>I NEED to learn of what, or who, is in that black emptiness. To know how Dreams work, where they go, how they gain knowledge. To know what is real and what isn't.<BR>To know the Truth.
Dream of emptiness.
Contacting the Unknowable
If it's true that all Dreams go through the Void, then chances are I am not the only Dreamer whose quest for knowledge focuses there.<BR>It is time to unVeil the Truth. Time for me to contact other Dreamers. No matter the risk, no matter how great or powerful they may be, or what intentions they may have.<BR>No matter what they may be, how different, how alien they may prove to me.<BR>No matter where they come from. From what world, time, reality.<BR>Nothing matters now. This may very well be the end of my research. If it must be like that, so be it, and I hope these notes prove useful to posterity.<BR>I must Dream of Eldritchness, under the influence of Void. I must fix my ears, to hear everything that is told to me. Listen as closely as I can. And be ready for a Dream longer than most.
Gracious Gods, don't let my mind crumble as I write this.<BR>A voice. It came from the Ocean. I didn't hear it, I felt it. Through my Dream it touched my body.<BR>It didn't speak to me, but through me, as if it didn't notice I was there, in my Dream.<BR>Yet I know now what I must do. The thought was imprinted in my mind.<BR>I must find the place where the blackness of the Void touches the surface, so I may see it and handle it myself.<BR>But, to be sincere, I do not know whether to continue in my search for knowledge...<BR><BR><BR>Merciful Gods, have mercy upon me.<BR>Don't let me drown.
Dream of Eldritch.
Finding Strongholds
It is of no surprise that Eldritch Dreams are correlated with the End, in its closeness to the Void.<BR>When not powered by a Void Dream, an Eldritch Dream will tell me the exact location of a single Stronghold.
Dreams of Dark
Before entering the Ocean, I could feel sand beneath my...  beneath my Dream. Dark, slimy sand, the color of Void.<BR>There are indeed reports of damp, blackened beaches, and, furthermore, rumour has it that some of these "Voided" biomes are inhabited by small groups of reclusive fishermen.<BR>I wonder if they can provide any clues towards my quest for knowledge. In any case, my goal now is to Dream of Darkness. A new, well imprinted Memory.
Far from perfect, Dreams of Darkness still prove useful in seeking Voided Biomes within limited range.<BR>However, I fear disappointment. Could some black grains of sand truly grant us enlightenment? I think not.<BR>Maybe I should instead focus on seeking the Fishing Hamlets that are rumoured to appear in these places.<BR>I know very well that not all Voided biomes will hold a Hamlet, so my research may take very long. I can comfort myself, knowing how much of the world I'll discover in my travels.<BR>Yet I am left to wonder, how much of it is real, and how much is naught but a wretched lie?<BR>After learning there is so much Beyond our world, so much more than meets the eye.. I am left in agonizing doubt.
Dream of Darkness.
The Fishing Hamlet
I need the Truth. I am sick of lies.<BR>There is a Veil of illusions clouding everyone's mind, there has to be. Everything I see, is a Lie.<BR>NOTHING BUT A LIE.<BR>I must breach it. I must see Beyond that barrier.<BR>Whether the Fishing Hamlet is the key to the Arcanum, or merely a piece of a grand puzzle, we shall see.
This can't be..<BR>All this work, all this research.. led me here?!<BR>To a bunch of degenerates?! Of xenophobic nitwits?!?<BR>Nonono, I can't stop now. I can breach the Veil. I know I can. I know it. I really do.<BR>I need to talk with the Lighthouse Keeper. I hope he proves wiser than his fellow Dwellers.
Look at the Ocean.. look at the Ocean..
Locate a Fishing Hamlet.
Talk with the Lighthouse Keeper.
Communion
At times, we think of ourselves as gods. Allmighty, invincible gods to whom the whole world must bow. Gods whose creations could reshape the world entire.<BR>And we're no more than deluded fools.<BR>The Ocean.<BR>Immense, timeless, inscrutable. Could it really care of what we do? Could it really, when it dwarfs our greatest, grandest structures, when it outlives our strongest, toughest contraptions?<BR>A symbol of immensity, ever close, to remind us of our INSIGNIFICANCE.<BR>The Ocean, whose immensity the Hamlet Dwellers seem so fascinated by, is UNKNOWABLE. We could spend whole eternities in the hope of researching its every nook and cranny, and yet vainly, for in its boundlessness, as well as its ever changing, chaotic nature, the things that lie within it.. or beneath it.. will always elude us. Unless they come to us.<BR>Yes, the Ocean must be the key. In its boundless, unkowable immensity, it is SURE to conceal what we're looking for. Some kind of gateway, some sort of door that will let us see Beyond the Veil. In its bottomless depths, we must look for rifts.<BR>Water itself REEKS of Eldritchness, and especially in that Hamlet of bizarre degenerates worshipping some kind of.. of..<BR>Yes. Of.. of course. They're far from degenerates, for they found the solution far before US.<BR>If their Deity truly is a manifestation of what's Beyond the Veil, hiding the Truth from us all, and if their fascination with Dreams and the Ocean is of the same nature as ours.. then we must seek Communion.<BR>Communion with the Great Dreamer.
I humbly pledge my life to You, Great Dreamer.<BR>I disavow all my previous beliefs, any gods I may have previously believed in.<BR>I am insignificant to you. The Ocean, Your presence on the Overworld, is symbol of that.<BR>You are unknowable to me. The Void, full of emptiness, is Your inscrutable substance.<BR>Beyond You lie all things. The Truth, hidden by a Veil.<BR>Grant us knowledge, so we may undo all lies.<BR>Grant us strength, so we may survive the Truth.<BR>Grant us courage.. so we may hear Your Holy Voice.
Pray at the Idol in the Hamlet.
Slugs
To commune with The Great Dreamer is an honor of the highest order. Truly, to have made an impression on Him so as to have sparked His interest is, undoubtedly, the greatest achievement I have ever accomplished.<BR>Yet the strength of the communion is ever faint, for I am weak, and my presence hopelessly bound to the Overworld.<BR>He knows that. He wishes to aid me. Really, He does!<BR>Slimy, shapeless, uncatchable like the water from which they are born. Such are the white slugs on which some Dwellers of the Hamlet feed. They are the key.<BR>I need a bait, and The Great Dreamer provides me with knowledge of how to create one. How ironic, though meaningful, that those shapeless chaotic slugs are so attracted by the perfect, orderly shape of common salt!<BR>The slug bait must be placed in water. There must be no water on top of it, but it must be surrounded by water on its 4 sides. For best performance it should be in the center of an 11x11 square of water.<BR>If the requirements are met, and I am able to see the faintest of particles, I should soon see the watery essence of the slugs on the water surface. They seemingly appear from nothingness, and pop back out of existence in a few moments. I must aim carefully my slug catcher at them, and use it.<BR>Then.. I must eat them. It's the only way. I won't like, but I must.<BR>Once I've eaten a few, say, twenty or so, I must interact with the Idol again.
My Dreams have become stronger, I know it, I know it I know it I KNOW IT.<BR>He heard me, The Great Dreamer HEARD MY CALLS.<BR>I realize now that to worship The Great Dreamer is not just an occasional prayer. It is, instead, a way of life.<BR>From now on, our course of action should be to eat slugs, slugs, and even more slugs. They'll start to taste less and less awful, I am certain.<BR>I must also get closer and closer to the Dwellers, and learn from them. Do deeds which make me more like them. They have known best for generations, after all. And my ancestors couldn't see it.<BR>Once all is done, I must interact with the Idol.
Eat 20 slugs, interact with Idol.
Fishermen
First, I'll record here the correct steps for a successful manual use of the bait.<BR>The slug bait must be placed in water. There must be no water on top of it, but it must be surrounded by water on its 4 sides. For best performance it should be in the center of an 11x11 square of water.<BR>If the requirements are met, and I am able to see the faintest of particles, I should soon see the watery essence of the slugs on the water surface. They seemingly appear from nothingness, and pop back out of existence in a few moments. I must aim carefully my slug catcher at them, and use it.<PAGE>Secondly, I am loathe to realize that this manual task will, in the long run, become a bore. The grey robed fishermen in the Hamlet however seem well versed in the art of slug catching.<BR>I can thus employ them to my needs. Interacting with them with a gold ingot in hand will make them follow me, and I'll be able to bring them near to a slug bait, then maybe give them a small nudge to get them on top of it.<BR>Once on the bait, I must ensure they get a steady supply of gold ingots. For each one they get, they'll fish for a minute. The slugs will be dropped on the ground, or get put in a chest adjacent to the Dweller.<BR>I might want to build around them so they do not leave their position.
Gifts from the Deep
The Hamlet Dwellers' diet, other than slugs, consist mostly of fish. Their barrels are full of cod.<BR>It seems they use their canoes to go fishing. These are built by the carpenters, the Dwellers with dark brown suits who live in two-story houses with normal oak ladders.<BR>Not every Hamlet has carpenters, but they're fairly common.  
According to the carpenter, the Dweller Fishermen ride their canoes into the Ocean and.. the fish just come to them?<BR>I should attempt that as well, not just in any water but in those of the Ocean itself.<BR>If anything does in fact happen, I shall keep at it for a while, then top it off with a fair deal of slugs. After that, I shall commune.
The Ocean itself.. it answers to me, its crashing waves a soothing voice, its blue immensity a vigilant eye, its shapeless water a loving hand.<BR>I have a link with the Ocean now, I am stronger because of it, especially in the water that binds us.<BR>And yet, our link is not strong enough.. I am still a creature of the surface, am I not?
Talk with the Hamlet's carpenter.
Sail the Ocean with a Canoe, then commune.
Baptism
I was born from water, like all things that be. I live by water, my means of Holy Communion.<BR>So why can't I breathe it? Why does it still hinder my movement?<BR>It makes me strong, and at the same time weakens me.<BR>It grants me life, and yet it can kill me.<BR><BR>The Dwellers though.. they bask in its touch, even its depths. So why can't I?<BR>We must ask the Lighthouse Keeper, one last time.
I am immortal. Right? I am, am I not?<BR>Maybe it isn't death I fear, but failure. A fate even worse, I reckon. Over and over, it will drive me to madness. And what good is immortality then?<BR>The pool must be tight. One by one wide, and exactly five blocks deep, all of it filled by still water.<BR>I must let myself sink in it, and once I reach the bottom, I must commune, eating a slug.<BR>Then I'll wait. And I will believe, like never before.<BR>Merciful God, don't let me drown.
I was born from water, like all things that be. I live by water, my means of Holy Communion.<BR>Now, I am water.<BR>Now, I am something. I hope.<BR>To know more of the Truth means to know less of myself. Am I truly a worthless wretch?<BR>My certainties grow weaker.
Talk with the Lighthouse Keeper.
Drown. Then the Idol. 
Alliance
In time, I shall grow yet stronger.<BR>But where is it I go from now?<BR>I must wait for signs. There is nothing I can do by myself.. nothing.
DAGON.<BR>Ancient scrolls speak of Him in hushed tones, proclaiming Him the Ruler of the Abyss, King of the Deep Ones.<BR>The first and foremost worshipper of The Great Dreamer.<BR>He noticed me. He sent a Deep One to my aid, though temporarily.<BR>Have I impressed Him? Could He be seeking an Alliance of sorts?<BR>Now that my research leaves the scope of the Dwellers' knowledge, it is time to seek greater aid.<BR>Dagon, I accept Your offer, and I shall speak with You again at the bottom of the Ocean.
It RINGS inside of me.<BR>His voice, like a booming drum of war, not asking but COMMANDING.<BR>Three golden blocks I've been given. I shall give them to the grey robed fisherman Dwellers of the Hamlet, then commune.<BR>I have no intention to learn what would happen were I to disobey.<BR>Oh, what have I gotten myself into.
By The Great Dreamer.. I was mistaken.<BR>Dagon has offered me a boon like no other.<BR>By holding myself into a stance of power I am capable of summoning a Deep One to my aid. Hold to choose, tap to cast.<BR>Is this power worth it? And the knowledge that comes with it?<BR>I will journey forth. After all.. do I have any choice?
Wait. Hope.
Eat a slug in the deepest oceans.
Bring the gold to the Dwellers. Commune.
Metamorphosis
Dagon calls me.<BR>I must speak with Him again.<BR>I cannot escape.
The Guardians in the Ocean Monuments.. belong to Dagon?<BR>Yet He asks me to slay them, merely as a test. He must pass Judgement upon me.<BR>What does He mean with "join His ranks"? Do I not serve Him already?
To whoever is unfortunate enough to come into possession of these writings..<BR>Stop reading for a moment. Look at your skin. Take a second to admire it. Your own, beautiful, candid skin.<BR>Now imagine. Imagine it turning blue. Slowly losing its color. Imagine then seeing it crack and break like dried stone.<BR>Imagine seeing it replaced, replaced by hard blue scales, surrounded by greenish mucus. Slimy, sticky, smelly, this horror is none other than yourself.<BR>Your head thrown forwards, your jaw opening three-ways, your spine bursting into a dorsal fin.<PAGE>I've always held my own self somewhat in contempt, for my insecurities, my failures, my flaws.<BR>This new shape is a blessing.<BR>I am remade in the shape of God. Or, at least, of His Archpriest Dagon.<BR>I am perfect, a wonderful horror.<BR>In my love and hatred for this form, I'll say it's one of power. I acquire great strength and resistance to harm, especially underwater.<BR>I, however, also lose the ability to wear armor and to wield any items other than a handful of marine ones, such as slugs and fish.<BR>There's more to this power than I currently know, I'm sure. I'll need to look for other abilities this shape has.<BR>I thank You, Dagon, for now I am Deep.
Eat a slug in the deepest oceans.
Slay three Elder Guardians. Commune.
Dream Bottle
I shed a tear when I was baptised.<BR>A sliver of Truth, it was, reminding me of my worthlessness.<BR>And yet, it was that very tear that led me to *know*.<BR>I cannot amass my own tears, I am no professional Weeper, am I?<BR>Am I?<BR>I'll seek help in bodies other than mine.
Through Weepers and Fleti I am granted knowledge, and through Dreams I shall utilize and magnify such knowledge.<BR>A Dream Bottle is what I must craft. An invaluable tool that will let me Dream limitless times per day, with multiple Memories at a time.<BR>The only price will be tears. But not my own.
The Dream Bottle stores tears. It can be used on a Lacrymatory to be filled up to its maximum capacity, and used again to be emptied as much as possible.<BR>It can store up to 4 buckets of tears.<BR>It can then be used without sneaking to be filled with Memories, up to four.<BR>Now, whenever I drink the Bottle's contents while sneaking I will be able to Dream anywhere, anytime, as many times as I want.<BR>One bucket of tears for every Dream, that's the exchange rate.<BR>As I learn of this new tool, new possibilities open up to me in the art of Dreaming.
Find a way to gather tears.
Craft a Dream Bottle.
Addendum:<BR>It seems that being worshipped through the use of a statue slightly improves the Dream-to-Tears efficiency of the Bottle.
Water Walking
Great Father Dagon, I am coming.
The End is engulfed in Void, the outer bulwark of the Veil, of The Great Dreamer Himself.<BR>It is there that I must Dream, while in water. I must Dream of Darkness, of Eldritch, of Learning and of Void, all at the same time. I know this, somehow.<BR>I cannot use a bed or a Sleep Chamber while in water, so I must take a third route to Dream.
Water Walking is the art of becoming one with the Ocean.<BR>When I use the power, while in water, I will be transported to any location or entity I am looking at, provided they are also in water.<BR>Additionally, using it while sneaking will set a waypoint. Doing that again will transport me back to that waypoint, then deleting it.<BR>Truly, I am now ever closer to the Ocean, a part of its very essence.<BR>A tiny, insignificant part in its unknowable immensity.
Eat a slug in the deepest oceans.
Bathe in the End and Dream. Then Commune.
Watery Cradle
Useless worms plague this world, living in their placid isles of ignorance.<BR>The Great Dreamer teaches me how best to employ them.<BR>I will make their bodies, maybe their corpses, mine to experiment upon.<BR>They are insignificant, after all.
Villagers don't serve much use to the world, do they?<BR>Now they will. Through me.<BR>The Watery Cradle, where patients drift off in Dreams, giving me right and duty to do with their bodies what I wish, through the use of Surgery Tools.<BR>Three units of a Watery Cradle must be put in a line, then I shall interact with one of its ends.<BR>Patients will come through the use of a very simple blackjack, made to stun them into unconsciousness. Using it upon a Villager will put him on the ground, ready to be picked up by interacting with him while sneaking.<BR>I can then place the Held Villager into the Watery Cradle, and find ways to experiment.<BR>It is none other than The Great Dreamer Himself who grants this knowledge upon me. Oh, the honor!
Craft three Watery Cradles.
Ripping spines
A god among men is no different from a man among worms.<BR>Rip their spines and make them CRAWL.
Willpower resides in the spine. Without it, the Villager will never get up, never rebel.<BR>The Villager is defenseless, in body and mind. No order of mine will remain unanswered.<BR>Problem is, there is nothing for them to do, in this new status of even greater uselessness. I must find a way to employ their servitude.<BR>Meanwhile, the spines themselves are an interesting boon. Besides the obvious bonemeal they provide, they are sources of willpower, the will to keep standing.<BR>And of fear. A ripped spine is no pretty sight, until one gets used to it that is.<BR>I'll surely find uses for them, soon enough.
Rip a spine.
Tearing hearts
Blood is life.<BR>Blood is water. Water is life.<BR>The relation is clear. And so is the irony.<BR>To gain life, I must grant death.
A heartless Villager has no life left to live. He'll expire in moments.<BR>Their hearts, however, will keep living, beating.<BR>When placed on the ground, the heart will attract undead, for they seek life.<BR>And yet, as a symbol of life, I am sure there's more that can be done with them.
Tear a heart.
Weepers
The person I once was would've reeled in disgust at the idea of ripping spines and tearing hearts. Now I barely flinch.<BR>But this..? This new idea that springs forth in my mind, through the uncanny doings of The Great Dreamer? Even now my hands tremble.<BR>To fill their brains with water, to make them SEE things as they truly are. Their brains filled, so they may only weep.
A tear is a revelation. All should fear the ones who weep, for they know more than most.<BR>A Weeper is a Villager whose head was enlarged to monstruos size, filled by water.<BR>A Fletum is a Weeper who's lost its spine. It needs no body, it is whole within its head.<BR>They Dream, they learn, they weep. I must harvest their tears, they are knowledge.
It is most natural to weep when one learns something. The sudden realization of one's own insignificance is no small deal, after all.<BR>It should not be held back, nor frowned upon, for tears are precious. A sign of humility before the Truth, and all that it entails.<BR>A Lacrymatory is where one should weep, in case one wishes to preserve their tears, to be then picked up through buckets. For some reason, when fallen into the Lacrymatory their power does not expire.<BR>And so it is, that Weepers and Fleti come to usefulness. A Weeper can be picked up directly through the use of a blackjack, whereas a Fletum requires only my bare hands, while sneaking, disgusting as it may be.<BR>Both of them can be used upon the Lacrymatory, and they'll weep in it. They must not wander far, and thus it is important to build around them so they don't escape.<BR>Additionally, only one of them can be used per Lacrymatory, and no two of them, whether they be Weeper or Fletum, should be too close to each other. No less than three blocks, per say.<BR>After all, how many times have I cried in my loneliness?
Fill a brain with water.
Craft a Lacrymatory.
Ring of Revelation
Weepers and Fleti lack eyes, yet they see more than most.<BR>Their tears are precious, and I shall dampen a ring with them.
The Ring of Revelation lets me see the unseen.<BR>When its passive effect is turned on, all invisible entities shall be revealed to me.<BR>When its active power is used, all such entities will outright lose their invisibility, leaving them for the whole world to see.<BR>Nothing shall lie unseen to me again.
Craft a Ring of Revelation.
Bleeding Belt
As my knowledge grows, so does my life become more precious.<BR>It must be preserved.<BR>I will gladly make sacrifices, of all kinds.<BR>Blood is the key.
When worn, the Bleeding Belt oozes the dark red fluid, of unknown origin for it isn't mine.<BR>What I do know is that, when its passive effect is enabled, it bathes me with life in exchange for hunger.<BR>Any time I am struck, my health shall be unharmed for as long as my stomach isn't empty.
Craft a Bleeding Belt.
Bone Tiara
If it is true that one must fight fire with fire, then I shall be the first to fight fear with fear.<BR>No terrors shall break my will.
The things I see as my knowledge grows send shivers down my spine.<BR>Hopefully, they'll now send them through someone else's.<BR>A tiara of bones will now adorn my head. As long as its passive effect is on, I shall be immune to Terror and Folly. My will will not break.<BR>Not yet.
Craft a Bone Tiara.
Covenant of Blood
Through blood, different lives are linked.<BR>The dark red fluid is not of this world, and the links are of eldritch nature. I may find use for such bonds, yet this time I cannot do it alone. I need other Players.
The relation between blood and water grows ever closer.<BR>All life came from water, after it turned to blood. All life is linked by this one origin.<BR>The Covenant of Blood is based upon these links. When I activate it while submerged in water, I will for a few brief moments see all other Players who, like me, wear the ring and are waterborne.<BR>When looking at one of them, activating the ring again will let me instantaneously travel to my ally. 
Craft a Covenant of Blood.
Crown of Thorns
If I am ever to be struck down, I want it to be by my own hand.<BR>Until then, I must defy death. Again and again.<BR>I need the WILL to LIVE.
Sprinkled with blood and dust of dorsal spines, the Crown of Thorns is a thing of horror.<BR>When its passive effect is active, it grants me the will and strength to keep standing after a blow that would've been final, piercing my forehead and bathing me in my own blood.<BR>Yet no boon comes without a price. After the effect takes hold I will be mortal again for a short period, at the end of which the damage that was negated will finally be dealt.<BR>I must use the Crown wisely, and be ready to heal.
Craft a Crown of Thorns.
Charm of Azacno
Aeons ago, a great parasite fell from the Cosmos.<BR>Unknown in shape and intent, it laid its nest in the deepest Oceans.<BR>Sucking blood, bringing fear and granting knowledge. To know him is to reach a culmination of my experiments.
Azacno was born from a rift in the Veil, yet not one from below our Oceans.<BR>Instead, he came from the stars, crashing into our waters, and communing with The Great Dreamer.<BR>He is of parasitical nature, and so are his followers. The Charm of Azacno is a feared talisman that infects the enemies of its wearer.<BR>Using its active power grants me for a few seconds the ability to infect others, unless they wear the Charm themselves.<BR>Monsters, animals and other mindless beasts will simply be driven back by the terror instilled by the infection.<BR>It is on other Players, however, that the effect is most terrible.<BR>An infected Player slowly succumbs more and more to the infection, as it grows worse and worse. In the end, the effects may even become visible to the eye.<BR>A fate that not even death will save one from. I do not know of any cures yet.<BR>It is of note that this charm is not magical in nature. It is merely a symbol by which Azacno recognizes me as one of his sect, and grants me this power.<BR>It is important I seek alliance with those others who worship The Great Dreamer.
Craft a Charm of Azacno.
Worship
Those worthless wretches, the spineless Villagers, need not be turned into Fleti to be of use.<BR>Bound to the ground as they are, they may think themselves helpless and useless. Fool's worries, I say! All they need is a guide.<BR>Or, rather, a God.<BR>I will gladly lend myself to the cause.<BR>A symbol is needed. Say, a Statue.<BR>Then, a link. My blood will do.<BR>Blood makes for powerful binding, after all.
How pretty. It depicts me as I pray and appease my own God.<BR>I must set an example for my followers, don't I?<BR>The Statue must be placed, then surrounded with crawling Villagers, their spines ripped and their wills broken.<BR>Of course, I must also make sure they don't flee from duty. They are to be imprisoned.<BR>Lastly, I need to cut myself on the Statue, to link it to me. It is an act of self sacrifice.<BR>I must set an example, after all.
I feel them. Their prayers.<BR>This must be what it's like to be a GOD.<BR>They leave me strengthened, my powers invigorated.<BR>For instance, more Deep Ones can be summoned through my pact with Dagon.<BR>It takes less time for me to recover from activating Powers or Baubles. Even Dreams seem to grow stronger.<BR>Only a single Statue can be used at a time, but that is enough.<BR>I, now, am truly godly. I am grand, mighty, I am.. I am..<BR>..do I deserve all this? Or have I sinned of arrogance?
Craft a Statue.
Link a Statue to myself. 
Statue of Sacrifice
Could I seek meaning in selflessness?<BR>To pay myself for someone else's wellbeing? Quite a change from my previous attitudes, and yet, I have followers to take care of now!<BR>I shall build a Statue that portrays me in a very different position, then.
I feel a bit better with myself now, and that's quite something in this journey of hopelessness.<BR>The Statue of Sacrifice does everything the normal Statue does, though it takes slighty more crawlers to achieve the same power.<BR>However, when I'm under its effects, I can use the Sacrificial Altar by using a Sacrificial Knife upon it, instead of sacrificing a Villager, and holding the stack in my other hand instead of dropping it on the ground.<BR>Additionally, every time I take damage all my nearby combat minions (such as summoned Deep Ones, and the like) are strengthened and healed.<BR>Lastly, my patients in the Watery Cradle seem truly inspired by my acts. So much so, that they follow in my footsteps of sacrifice and at times choose to relinquish two hearts, instead of one! However that may be possible.<BR>An example, that's what I must be! Even if it means pain!<BR>After all, I do deserve some Penitence.
Craft a Statue of Sacrifice.
Statue of Penitence
I have sinned. I have sinned.<BR>In my arrogance I forgot my insignificance.<BR>I must right these wrongs. With blood.<BR>My own.<BR>I will build a new Statue, one that shows my regret.
This feels more.. right.<BR>I wanted to play God, despite being so, so tiny. It's only right that I suffer some punishment.<BR>The Statue of Penitence does everything the normal Statue does, though it takes slighty more crawlers to achieve the same power.<BR>However, when I'm under its effects, I am reminded of my own flaws, my failures, my weaknesses.<BR>With a Sacrificial Knife, I will cut myself while wielding a sword in the main hand, for I've always been weak.<BR>I will cut when I wield a shovel, an axe, a pickaxe, for I've always been slow.<BR>Even the hoe.. for the green thumb I never had.<BR>When the worshippers are enough, even the Crown of Thorns may become easier to use.<BR>The way of pain is an arduous one, yet not impossible.<BR>All it takes is a little Sacrifice.
Craft a Statue of Penitence.
Statue of Valour
There is no such thing as Valour.<BR>And even if there were, I'd be no paragon.<BR>This research is a dead end.
Altar of Sacrifice
I revel in limitless gratitude towards my Patron, yet in agony.<BR>For there is no way I can duly offer Him my thanks.<BR>Or is there?<BR>Blood makes for powerful bonds. It is water and life, all at once.<BR>It is the link that binds all things living to the deepest oceans.<BR>Through blood shall I thank Him, through life and water.<BR>An Altar of Sacrifice, of Hearts and Prismarine.<BR>First, a core.
I must build a structure, as described below. The hearts will be expended for every sacrifice. I can interact with bare hands with the Core to make sure it's been built correctly.<BR>A heartless villager is to be placed upon the Core. He'll expire in seconds. Then, a boon.<BR>My offerings will be rewarded. Dropping items on the altar before the sacrifice might turn them into something else.<BR>For instance, stone bricks become blood in color and essence. A new resource, one of unknown properties.<BR>A sacrifice without valid offerings will result in a health boost.<BR>I thank You, Great Dreamer, with all my hearts.
Craft a Sacrificial Altar Core.
Coral Staff
In their unholy penitence, undead seek life.<BR>However, they're imbeciles.<BR>It shouldn't be a difficult task to redirect them from one beating heart to the next, their "minds" fooled by what seems better flesh.<BR>I *know* the exact tool I need.
How bizarre it is that the corals of the deep look so similar to our own arteries.<BR>No coincidence, I am certain. The link between the two is strong.<BR>And it is through this very staff that I may bind hearts together. Interacting with a placed heart while sneaking will store its position in the staff. Once done, interacting while sneaking with another heart (within no more than 32 blocks of distance) will bind the old one's position to this new one's. Any undead that are attracted to the first will then be redirected to the second, which may be also linked to yet another heart, resulting in a true procession of the damned.<BR>If the staff stores a position, it may be cleared by using it while sneaking on the very same heart it was taken from, or while aiming in the air. Using the staff without sneaking will give info on itself or on a clicked heart.<BR>There is, in truth, another use to the staff: attacking an enemy with it will result in nearby undead targeting it, in their endless pursuit of blood and life.
Craft a Coral Staff.
Blood Well
If the undead's desire for blood is so great, then I shall answer to that desire as best as I may.<BR>I shall cover them with the sweet, red substance.<BR>I will build a well that will hoard such undead, bind them to me, so that I may rule them.<BR>A simple structure of blood bricks. The heart must be placed last.
The Well still beats. The dead are drawn towards it, even more so than to normal hearts.<BR>Once they enter the Well, the dead are gone, stored in it. Or, rather, through it.<BR>Blood Sigils can be made for both Zombies and Skeletons. When these undead enter the Well they can later be reacquired through the use of Sigils by using these on the central block of the Well. The Sigils can then be used on the ground to summon my own Blood Undead.<BR>Sigils can be emptied in the Well by sneaking. Summoned Blood Undead can be put back in the Sigil by using it upon them.<BR>I do not know how the Well stores the dead. I imagine it could be a link to some other location, in or out of this world. I truly wish I could enter it myself.<BR>Alas, I am not dead as of yet.
Build a Blood Well.
Shoggoth
Shoggoths.<BR>Shapeless masses of flesh, washed away aeons ago on the Sea's shores.<BR>Slaves to the Elder Things, builders of cities.<BR>They're born from tears.<BR>I must create a Shoggoth Vat. That is, a 3x3x3 cube of tears, making sure each block is filled. Then three Fleti must be placed in it.<BR>Once all is done, I must enter it, and through a Dream Bottle I must Dream simultaneously of Darkness, Eldritchness, Learning and Void.<BR>A Shoggoth is no gentle creature. It will attack all animals and all Players other than its owner on sight. If it becomes too delighted in killing, then not even its owner is safe.<BR>A Shoggoth is to be picked up through a blackjack, provided that it is sufficiently calm.
City Mapping
Shoggoths once built cities.<BR>They shall do so again.
A City Mapper can create a map schematic that is then to be given to a Shoggoth.<BR>I can place buildings from the menu on the right onto the map. Buildings must not intersect each other and must be fully contained within the map's borders.<BR>Buildings can be rotated before or after placement with the mouse wheel.<BR>Buildings on the map can be moved by clicking on them and deleted by moving them outside the map.<BR>I must save changes before exiting the Mapper and before creating the schematic.<BR>Once the schematic is made, I can then give it to a Shoggoth.<BR>Of course, I must also make sure the Shoggoth isn't distracted by any animals, other Players or other Shoggoths.<BR>As of now, there's only a handful of block types the Shoggoth can create. Maybe in the future I'll find more.<BR>The Shoggoth creates such blocks by itself, but I can synthesize them myself as well, if needs be.<BR>Lastly, I should remember to light up buildings soon after they're built, as they have no source of lighting themselves.
Craft a City Mapper.
Clinic
The Clinic seems to have been designed specifically for Weepers and Fleti, it seems.<BR>A bizarre discovery, given how ancient its design must be. How long have Weepers existed for?<BR>Its interior is split in multiple chambers. Each one contains a chiseled block in the floor, where a Lacrymatory is meant to be placed.
Dreams of Death
A Dream of Death, as I respawn once again.<BR>Yet I am not the only one that cannot truly die.<BR>With this Memory, I can invade the privacy of another random Player, and discover the last place where they died, hopefully profiting off their spoils.<BR>No grave is too sacred.
It seems that targeting myself with a Death Dream, through a Player Sigil bound to myself used on the Dream Shrine, allows me to outright teleport to my last Overworld death's location.<BR>But how? How can a simple Dream shift my whole body?<BR>Could this be a key to breaching the Veil?
Dreams of Mending
A Dream of Mending, as I smite the hammer on the anvil.<BR>I cannot truly die, yet many of my tools are fraught with mortality. This Memory influences the very matter I am surrounded with, and repairs the items I am wearing and wielding.
Dreams of Animals
A Dream of Animal, as I feed one with my own hands.<BR>Dropping a specific item near to me before I Dream of this Memory will spawn nearby an animal related to that item.<BR>Where my Dream plucks that creature from, I can only speculate.<PAGE>Examples of usable items would be porkchop for pigs, bones for wolves, leather for cows, horses and even llamas. Of course there are more to discover.
Dream Shrine
The Nether lies halfway between the Overworld and the Deepest Oceans. Surrounded by Void on both sides, it is closer to the true Void, the true Veil that lies beneath All.<BR>Even that accursed land of fire was born from water.<BR>Like all things that be.<BR>And even though it's small in surface compared to the Overworld, some Dreams go through it still.<BR>Quartz makes for a powerful conductor, not only of redstone but even of Dreams.<BR>A Shrine of Dreams, made of Quartz, to cast them wherever I desire. That is my new goal.<BR>All I require is a way to bind specific locations.. even specific people.. to focus my Dreams towards them.
The Dream Shrine is to be used in tandem with the Dream Bottle, as well as a Pathway or Player Blood Sigil.<BR>The correct creation of the structure can be verified by using on the central chiseled quartz block either one of those sigils.<BR>While standing exactly on top of the central chiseled quartz block, by holding the Dream Bottle in my main hand and the bound sigil in the offhand I am capable of casting Dreams towards specific locations or people.<BR>As an example, Dreams that inspect the ground will work as if they were used atop the location or Player bound in the sigil.<BR>Dreams that targeted random Players can now target specific ones, and even certain Dreams that would only affect myself can now be utilized upon others.<BR>From my base I am now able to see and command all kinds of things. A precious knowledge, one that must be kept tight and silent.
Find a way to bind locations.
Blood Sigils
Through blood we're bound not just to the Deepest Oceans, but to All.<BR>A Pathway Sigil can be used to bind to itself a location in the world, simply by using it.<BR>I should try it before bringing my research forwards.
Indeed, the Blood Sigil has forged an unbreakable bond.<BR>Through these Pathway Sigils I will be able to target specific locations.<BR>There is, however, another type of Sigil: the Player Sigil, that can bind a specific person to itself.<BR>More difficult to use, this one requires to be held in my hands, either main or offhand, as I injure another Player enough for them to bleed.<BR>Once their blood is in my hands, so too shall their fate be mine to dictate.
Make a Pathway Sigil.
Dreams of Flora
A Memory of Flora, as I grow more and more plants through bone meal.<BR>What could such a Dream entail?
I got an apple.<BR>Started Dreaming, woke up, an apple was in my hands.<BR>It came from nowhere. A mere Dream, capable of creating, or at least transporting matter?<BR>The implications are colossal, but also terrible.<BR>What could I truly achieve through Dreams? And what could other Dreamers do to me, were I to catch their attention?<BR>It's frightening.<BR>But hey, I got an apple!<BR>This Dream deserves further enquiry.
Dream of Flora.
Grass Seeds
The Flora Dream granted me a new kind of crop.<BR>These grass seeds are meant to be cultivated like normal wheat by placing them on tilled soil.<BR>The difference stands in the seeds themselves being the actual crop.<BR>Indeed, when used upon normal dirt these seeds are capable of covering it with lush grass. They are expended in the act, however.<BR>This first bunch of seeds should be used immediately on tilled soil to gain more of their kind, as I do not know whether further Flora Dreams will grant me the same type of seed.
Redstone Seeds
These seeds are more special than their grass counterpart.<BR>They are cultivated in the same way, yet these have different effects when utilized.<BR>They can be used upon both dirt and grass. When that happens, the grass is converted into Redstone Grass, a mimic type of block that looks exactly like normal grass, but produces a redstone signal when an entity stands upon it.<BR>An invisible trap, to catch unwanted intruders.
Ghost Seeds
These seeds are extremely light. They feel almost like air in my very own hands.<BR>They can be cultivated on tilled soil like the other two types of seeds.<BR>However, when used upon dirt or grass these seeds will transform that block into ghost grass, an ethereal block that is insubstantial on touch, but looks exactly like grass to the eye. Perfect for pitfalls and the like.<BR>Only now, however, do I reflect on the weirdness of these finds. These seeds are too bizarre to belong to this world.<BR>So where does the Dream go to pluck such treasures?
Arboreal Generator
Next time I Dream of Flora, I shall hold a diamond in my hand. Then something will happen.<BR>How do I know this? Well, it's that that I do not know.
This small, pretty tree is known as an Arboreal Generator.<BR>It is a useful plant, that slowly generates saplings on each of its four sides.<BR>It first creates small shrubs. These emit an extremely faint redstone signal, which might come in useful.<BR>These shrubs are then turned into saplings of various kinds.<BR>This plant does not belong to this world, I am certain.
Dream of Flora with a diamond in hand.
Vijhiss
My next Flora Dream should be made with a block of obsidian in my hand.<BR>I *know* something is going to happen.
This plant is somewhat unsettling.<BR>Not only because of its appearance, betraying no sense of belonging to this world.<BR>No, this plant is greedy.<BR>In the most literal sense, in fact!<BR>Vijhiss wants and accepts gold. Ingots fashioned from the noble yellow metal will solicit a reward from the plant.<BR>Vijhiss is capable of granting me numerous kinds of seeds, some from this world and some not, some that I have seen already and some entirely new.<BR>My only worry lies in the faint sense of glee that the plant emanates at every trade.
Dream of Flora with obsidian in hand.
Megydrea
Should I encourage the avid nature of Vijhiss?<BR>I don't trust that plant, yet the boons may be worth it.<BR>I'll try and give it a bigger piece of gold.
A new plant, granted to me by Vijhiss. I can obtain more of its kind by giving more gold blocks to that greedy weed.<BR>The Megydrea acts as a fluid tank. It is placed on the ceiling and hangs from there, two blocks tall.<BR>Up to forty buckets of any fluid can be stored.
Give Vijhiss a gold block.
Dreams of Beheading
A Memory of Beheading, as I cut off a wither skull.<BR>The thought is macabre, yet the death is quick and painless.<BR>Such a Memory can be used to gain my own head. Not a copy, I can swear it breathed up to mere moments ago.<BR>If used on the Dream Shrine while targeted towards a certain Player, it can be instead used to gain that Player's head.<BR>Do these heads not belong to this world? Or even this time?
Dreams of Heartbreak
A Memory of Heartbreak, as I lose a loyal friend.<BR>Slowly, sorrow is replaced with anger. Towards those who don't feel my pain, closed in their own cynicism.<BR>A tinge of hypocrisy there?<BR>Shush.<BR>A Memory of Heartbreak makes for a far more offensive Dream than most. When used all non Player creatures within a fairly large distance, as well as I, remain afflicted for a limited time. Our health will be lowered until the effect ends, and a proper combination with Memories of Power and of Stillness makes for an extremely powerful weapon.<BR>Of course, hurting myself in the process is not ideal. With the Dream Shrine, I can properly target specific locations to afflict all the non Player creatures in a 30 block radius centered on the Sigil's location without being penalized for it.<BR>And, of course, I may also target specific Players.<BR>Everyone's had dark periods in their life. I must only make them reminisce.
A Snippet Of Truth
I am close to a breach.<BR>Dagon calls.
The good keeper helped me so much.<BR>But there are countless more just like him. His death won't matter.<BR>Should I hear his last words?
No godly boon this time. Only a snippet of Truth, a knowledge that stings.<BR>Should I keep going? Will it matter?
Eat a slug in the deepest oceans.
Murder the Lighthouse Keeper.
Flute Of The Outer Gods
This Flute does not belong to this world. It weighs nothing, and it leaves a faint echo of unearthly melody.<BR>Although I am hesitant to touch it with my mouth, its effects are powerful.<BR>When playing it all creatures around me, even other Players, are taken by Folly, and writhe in madness.<BR>Even I could be affected, if my will didn't prove strong enough.<BR>Some creatures may be affected in more horrid ways. I should be careful.
Saw Cleaver
The Saw Cleaver was used by monster hunters in ages long past.<BR>My own ancestors.<BR>When used it switches between a contracted and elongated form. The former works like any sword, the latter allows me to hit all enemies around me at the cost of less damage and no knockback. Switching to the extended form while in combat will also result in an attack, if I time it right.<BR>Additionally, when wielding this weapon I am able to dodge like its ancient owners. By tapping the Dodge Key ('Alt' by default) I can quick step in the chosen direction.<BR>Yet, I am taken by doubt. Should I really follow in my ancestors' footsteps?
Wolf Medallion
A Medallion used by hunters in ages long past.<BR>Monster hunters.<BR>When its passive effect is on, I am periodically warned of the number of hostile monsters around me.<BR>When its active effect is used, I am able to temporarily see all nearby entities.<BR>And prepare for the worst.
Bronze Sphere
I've already held this sphere.<BR>I know I have.<BR>My mind BURNS with recollection as I hold the object.<BR>I hope that reaching the Truth will unVeil this mistery.<BR>For now, it's again in my hands, and I can use it to my advantage.<BR>When activated it enables me to store experience inside it. If I am sneaking the experience is pulled out instead.<BR>A battery of Memories, so to say.
Crucible
A weapon with a red hot blade, used by demon slayers in ages long past.<BR>One man armies they were, more terrible than any of their enemies.<BR>The Crucible is immensely powerful, capable of dishing out colossal damage for every hit.<BR>It is, however, balanced by the fact that for every swing the weapon needs around two minutes of recharging before it can be used again. And of course, many enemies of mine may not suffer too much damage in a single hit, so I must use it wisely.
Baubles
Some items are to be worn outside of my armor slots.<BR>The Baubles I encounter in this journey (and only this journey) may have both active and passive effects.<BR>By holding the Bauble key ('Z' by default) I can choose which Baubles must have their passive effect enabled and which single Bauble is to be the active one.<BR>There can be only one active Bauble, and its effect can be activated by tapping the Bauble Key.
Dreams of Introspection
A Memory of Introspection, as I reflect upon my own self while I walk among my worshippers.<BR>Through this Memory I can know more of the power I've obtained in my journey.<BR>Of course, were I to target someone else with the Dream I may also scry into their secrets.
Roaring
While transformed I am unable to use the active effects of my Baubles, as well as to open the Bauble Powers menu.<BR>In that form, however, I am instead able to release a blood curdling roar that will affect all entities around me with Terror, by tapping the same key I'd have used for the Active Bauble.<BR>To strike fear in my opponents' hearts is to be closer than ever to God.
To New Depths
We must keep going.<BR>Never yield, the Truth draws close, the Veil weakens, my knowledge grows, my will..<BR>What will is left? As if someone ripped my own spine.<BR>No, we'll keep going. We must.<BR>To the bottom of the deepest Oceans.<BR>To Arche, and then to Apeiron.<BR>Our journey won't end until we breach.. until we..<BR>..wait..<BR>..who's 'we'?
Dreams of Water
A Dream of Water, as the thought of the Ocean refuses to leave my mind.<BR>Through this Memory I am able to locate the nearest Ocean Monument.<BR>The Guardians are born from water itself, and as such are closest to God.
Dream Focus
Dream Foci are devices that, through their quartz structure and watery surface, can channel Dreams to move objects.<BR>Not my Dreams. Nor those of Weepers, who yet resist the final embrace.<BR>It is those of Fleti that I must harness, so lost in their desperate adoration of what lies Beyond.
A Dream Focus is a wondrous device.<BR>Its small end should be adjacent to the container I wish to pull items from. It can then be activated by placing a Fletum on its top.<BR>However, I must first choose the path the items will take, and I must do it myself.<BR>When no Fletum is on top of the Dream Focus, I can interact with the block with bare hands. I will then be transported to the large end of the Focus, facing away from it, and start to slowly move wherever I am looking, including in the air. This status lasts fifteen seconds, but I can exit it sooner by sneaking.<BR>Once all is done, the path is set. I can check the path at any time by wearing a Ring of Revelation with its passive effect enabled. I can toggle an individual path on and off by using a clay ball on its respective Focus. I may also apply dyes to the Dream Focus to change the path's color.<BR>With the path set, and a Fletum on top, the Focus will pull items from the container every seven and a half seconds. They will start to float in the air following the path I set, and drop on the path's end. All physics will still apply, and sharp turns around block edges may get the items stuck, so I must be careful when creating the path.<BR>The items can be picked up while in the air, by Players and hoppers alike. A careful combination of pathing and hoppers will result in a proper transportation system.<BR>The Focus can be turned off with a redstone signal.<BR>It also seems that floating swords and blackjacks retain their properties while flying through non Player creatures.<BR>Lastly, Villagers and Weepers in their item forms will be inserted in any Watery Cradle in their path.

Curtains
Curtains are our world's counterpart to the Veil. Separating Truth from lies, behind them act a stageful of actors.<BR>Yes, maybe our reality is really nothing but a theatre.<BR>Still, these curtains I mean to make are a fair deal more mundane. They'll simply act as filters for the items that collide with them.
Curtains act as filters for Dreams, just like the Veil. Some go through, some don't.<BR>In this case it's the Fleti's Dreams and the items they transport that may or may not pass.<BR>A Curtain must be placed under a container, such as a chest. Every time an item goes through, the Curtain checks whether the inventory above contains an instance of that item. If so, the item doesn't go through and stops floating, dropping instead to the ground or, preferably, to an aptly placed hopper.<BR>Having containers both above and below, with appropriate spacing between them to avoid all items being sucked in hoppers, makes for a fairly space-consuming setup, but one that can work well as a sorting system.

Dream Focus: Fluids
We should not stop at items! Fleti are more than capable of transporting other things.<BR>A Focus for Fluids would be a useful device.
Unlike its item counterpart, a Focus for Fluids plucks fluids from its top and ejects them from its bottom, which is where I'll be when starting to set the path.<BR>Fleti are to be placed on the device's sides, and up to four of them can be placed. Each one increases the amount of fluid transported at a time, in the order 100 -> 300 -> 600 -> 1000 millibuckets per go.<BR>Transported fluids will try to enter any tanks they come in contact with, and will disappear at the end of the path if no containers were found to store them.<BR>It is of note that Fleti that are "fueling" a Dream Focus of any kind will not prevent nearby Weepers or other Fleti from weeping into a Lacrymatory, thus making the Fluid Focus an appropriate method to empty Lacrymatories automatically.<BR>As a last note, floating water also appears to be a powerful fertiliser for nearby crops.
Craft a Dream Focus for fluids.
Dream Focus: Villagers
My soon-to-be patients, whom I already stripped of all worldly things, seem content in knowing they have nothing more to lose.<BR>Those poor, poor things.<BR>I will take even the floor away from them.
A Focus for Villagers is capable of moving Villagers in a path of my own choosing.<BR>The path begins from the block's top, by interacting with bare hands while no Fletum is activating the Focus. I will preserve my initial rotation after interacting with the block.<BR>Once the path is set, a Fletum must be placed below the Focus. Once that is done, the device will select every few seconds a Villager to move.<BR>The Villagers are taken from a 11x11 area centered on the Focus, up to 5 blocks above it. Crawling Villagers take precedence and are chosen before any standing ones. Child Villagers won't be taken, they must grow before reaching any usefulness.<BR>A redstone signal may be applied to the Focus to alter its functionality. A fully powered signal will disable the device altogether. A signal of strength between 1 and 14 instead determines how many adult standing Villagers will be left at all times in the area above.<BR>For example, with a signal of strength 3 and 2 standing Villagers above, none will be taken. This way their mating and reproduction is ensured.<BR>Crawling Villagers are exempt from this check, and will always be taken.<BR>If the Focus' path is aimed at a Watery Cradle, a floating Crawling Villager will automatically be placed in it if there are no patients already present. Of course, I must make sure to loop the path back to the Focus in case the Cradle wasn't empty.<BR>This is especially useful considering that a Blackjack floating through a Dream Focus for items will preserve its properties, and may even knockout Villagers while both item and victim are mid air.<BR>Of course, were I to fully automate surgery.. I'd need a Surgeon.
Craft a Dream Focus for Villagers.
Surgeon
A net of Dreams links all those who peeked into the Truth.<BR>Entire societes exist away from me, some of these offering their services to allies and patrons.<BR>My alliance with Dagon brings new contacts, and among these come the Surgeons, offering their skills to those who seek them.<BR>I must craft a letter, a summons of sorts, for a Surgeon to reach me.<BR>I then only need use it on the ground. I'll do it once, then sort the Surgeon's job's details later, once I've taken a look at him.
I had wondered why Surgeons would ever form a society of their own.<BR>Little did I know that a Surgeon is not a profession.<BR>No, it is a race.<BR>One that does not belong to my world.<BR>Is this a race made with intent? After all, they all share a singular purpose.<BR>...<BR>What if I, too, were part of a breed that was *made*, not by chance but by will? Without knowing, for how I could I?<BR>A Surgeon is a useful servant, or rather, ally.<BR>I must place him close to a Watery Cradle with which I want him, her, it, whatever, to work.<BR>I must then use Surgery Tools on him to specify which action I want performed.<BR>The Surgeon will then operate every time a patient appears in the Cradle, placing the resulting patient on top of the device and keeping hearts or spines to himself. I can then interact with him with bare hands to be given all materials he gathered.<BR>A much more useful technique however is that of binding the Summons to a nearby chest before using it. To do that I can interact with a chest, wielding the letter, while sneaking.<BR>I can clear the previous binding by right clicking in the air while sneaking.<BR>A Surgeon summoned with a bound Summons will put any output of his operations, both patients and materials, in the bound chest, provided they're sufficiently close to each other.<BR>Since Villagers and Weepers in item form can enter Cradles as well, I can effectively pipeline Surgeons one after the other.<BR>A Surgeon can be picked up by its master with a blackjack.

A new book lies in my hands, ready to be written. Al Azif I shall call it.
A fish? From nowhere? Did it jump in or...          ...I should keep at this for a while.
I think I've gained enough fish. I should eat enough slugs, then commune with the Idol.
I cannot sleep while transformed.
I don't feel all too well.. I can't sleep.
