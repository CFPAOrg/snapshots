Me fisher mates use 'em to.. fish. In the ocean.
An easy job theirs. The Ones from the Deep just give 'em fish.
You buying my stuff or no?
Oh. |{A traveller}[... ] :Welcome.
I imagine you stumbled upon our Hamlet by chance, in your endless travels.:I can only envy you, stuck as I am,{ watching this lighthouse.
I am left to wonder, though, what does an explorer like you think of our humble Hamlet? |Out of[ all] the beauties you must've admired, what impression does it leave upon you?
It strikes me:with a peculiar sense:of awe.
I do not like it.:There's an atmosphere:of hostility here.
{Ohh,} such a pleasure to hear it. Tell me then, traveller,:what is it that{ awes} you in such a{ peculiar} way?
The unique architecture,:how everything fits:upon the water on which it's built.
{Ahh, yes.}:We're very proud of what we've built.|| :And rebuilt. |  :And rebuilt over and over again, just for it to be[ burnt down.
You have no idea of what I'm referring to, right?:In your pursuit of knowledge of the world, you have ignored that of history.
The rare items I find here.:The loot.
Ah, not just a traveller, but a looter!:What items interest you the most?
The ancient artifacts.
Those artifacts aren't ours. Well, at least they weren't.:They were brought to us by friends, who took them from foes. |:You don't know what I'm referring to, right?
The slugs.
HA! |THE SLUGS! |Well, don't eat those! |:[You might regret it.
You can't[ even begin] to imagine how important those slimy creatures are to us.:They are our means of communion, with the God we chose to believe in.
Find that strange? Well, you should.:But if that{ "strangeness"} fills you with fear and hatred for us and our customs,| then you're no different from your ancestors.
You don't know what I'm referring to, right?
That doesn't surprise me,{ outsider}.:What is it you do not like?
The dwellers.:They seem to despise outsiders.
