Nobody won in those times. And all of it for{ your ancestors'} disdain for that which is different. For the dark sand below us, and the weird shape of our Deity.
Do you understand now why my fellow dwellers, as well as I, have such disdain for outsiders? Why we are so wary of them?
Who are these:'friends' you:spoke of?
I understand.:You have my sympathies.
That is none of your concern, for as long as you remain an outsider.:But that doesn't have to stay like that.
And you have my gratitude. For listening to my tale, our history.:For relieving me of the burden of knowledge.
Should you need to know more, ask.
You are a Dreamer. I know that. |:You seek Truth. I know that too.
You wish to breach the Veil. To venture Beyond it. |:Well, you already did, if only in Dream, unable to recall anything.
You now desperately try to convince yourself that you can do it. Succeed where all have failed. Ridding yourself of lies.
Help me.
I AM SICK:OF LIES.
We all are, until we realise how much worse the Truth is. ||:I will help you.
That statue, in the central square, it represents our marine Deity. |:The Great Dreamer.
You seek the Truth, The Great Dreamer hides it. |:To speak with Him, is to go{ Beyond the Veil.
Traveller, all Dreams go through water. Through The Great Dreamer. |:Look at the Ocean.
[Oh my.] |:You communed.
The slugs. Eat them. Even if they hurt.
I am impressed traveller. Truly. |:I am impressed by your resolve, your strength of will, your determination in your quest for knowledge, as dangerous as it may be.
I am impressed by your open mind, realising the misdeeds of your ancestors and disavowing them. |:And most of all, I am impressed at how wholly you pledge yourself to your new belief.
Be wary of disappointment. Sooner or later, it'll come. It'll sting.
For now, get on a canoe and sail. Talk to a carpenter.
But now, it's time you take the next step.
