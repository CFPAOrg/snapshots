Villagers don't serve much use to the world, do they?<BR>Now they will. Through me.<BR>The Watery Cradle, where patients drift off in Dreams, giving me right and duty to do with their bodies what I wish, through the use of Surgery Tools.<BR>Three units of a Watery Cradle must be put in a line, then I shall interact with one of its ends.<BR>Patients will come through the use of a very simple blackjack, made to stun them into unconsciousness. Using it upon a Villager will put him on the ground, ready to be picked up by interacting with him while sneaking.<BR>I can then place the Held Villager into the Watery Cradle, and find ways to experiment.<BR>It is none other than The Great Dreamer Himself who grants this knowledge upon me. Oh, the honor!
Craft three Watery Cradles.
Ripping spines
A god among men is no different from a man among worms.<BR>Rip their spines and make them CRAWL.
Willpower resides in the spine. Without it, the Villager will never get up, never rebel.<BR>The Villager is defenseless, in body and mind. No order of mine will remain unanswered.<BR>Problem is, there is nothing for them to do, in this new status of even greater uselessness. I must find a way to employ their servitude.<BR>Meanwhile, the spines themselves are an interesting boon. Besides the obvious bonemeal they provide, they are sources of willpower, the will to keep standing.<BR>And of fear. A ripped spine is no pretty sight, until one gets used to it that is.<BR>I'll surely find uses for them, soon enough.
Rip a spine.
Tearing hearts
Blood is life.<BR>Blood is water. Water is life.<BR>The relation is clear. And so is the irony.<BR>To gain life, I must grant death.
A heartless Villager has no life left to live. He'll expire in moments.<BR>Their hearts, however, will keep living, beating.<BR>When placed on the ground, the heart will attract undead, for they seek life.<BR>And yet, as a symbol of life, I am sure there's more that can be done with them.
