I have reason to believe that, within their own weird, a-dimensional plane of existence, Dreams are all adjacent to each other. To all others. At the same time, at all times.<BR>While their position may shift in relation to our world (such as when they go straight down through bedrock), my Dreams are tangent to all others.<BR>This is a breakthrough discovery. As a Dreamer more expert than most, I can probe the Dreams of others with my Own, learning things about them while ignoring any privacy they think they have. I should keep working on this ability, so that it may reach its full potential.<BR>Still, this new knowledge brings with itself a new fear.<BR>Fear that there could be other Dreamers, greater than myself, and that my excessive forays into Dreaming only made me more vulnerable.<BR>Other Dreamers, that could possibly not even be human.<PAGE>A Memory of Human was triggered by initiating a trade with one of those dim-witted Villagers. Sooner or later, I'll make them pay for their inane prices.<BR>This Memory makes for Dreams of no great consequence, for now. It enables me to know of the position of others like me, but just one of either their x or z coordinates, for a single unnamed human other than myself, provided there is at least one at the time of Dreaming.
Initiate a trade with a Villager, see where it leads.
A Memory of Tools, as I craft a powerful one.<BR>Yet, I burn with envy at the idea of others wielding items mightier than mine.<BR>Through this Memory, I can learn of what item is held in the main hand of a single unnamed human other than myself, provided there is at least one at the time of Dreaming. 
Tablet Inscriptions
These ancient stone tablets can be deciphered.<BR>Their contents may be unsettling, but my pursuit of knowledge won't be stopped by this. I hope.
I've managed to decipher these tablets, but I'm sure there are more. I'll record their content here.<BR>When completed, they can be used to learn new research, just like a Memory of Learning. Just like the Memory, they'll only be consumed if there's something to learn.
