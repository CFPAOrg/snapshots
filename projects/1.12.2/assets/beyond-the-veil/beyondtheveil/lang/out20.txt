Advanced Sleep Chamber
The Sleep Chamber is an extremely useful device, but the progress of research should never stop, it should know no bounds.<BR>New revelations spring to mind on how to make it reach its full potential.
The key was WATER. What this substance has to do with Dreaming I can't yet guess, but its addition in the Sleep Chamber's gears and wirings vastly improved its Dream-aiding capabilities.<BR>This Advanced Sleep Chamber lets me Dream twice as many times per day as the regular one. Not only that, it lets my Dream be influenced by two Fume Spreaders at the same time!<BR>Just think of the combinations!

Dreams of Void
A new Memory springs forth in my mind.<BR>The Void. Black, inscrutable, unknowable. Its essence is burned in my mind, like no Memory before.<BR>Dreams go through THE VOID.<BR>THAT is where they truly depart from the known world to go where nothing can follow them... yet.<BR>I am certain of this.<BR>I need to Dream of the VOID.<BR>Of its black emptiness.<BR>So I may reach it myself.
The Dream was far less flagrant that I imagined.<BR>A Dream of Void doesn't seem to affect me directly.<BR>However, were I to Dream again, after Dreaming of Void (or during, if I have the means to do so) then it seems my Dreaming capabilities are somewhat improved. Not terribly so, and it applies only to a scarce few Memories, but it's something.<BR>And yet, I shouldn't underestimate this Memory's importance.<BR>I believe that its true effect stands in slowing down my next Dream's descent, especially its stay in the Void. And if that is true, then my quest for knowledge might have reached a breakthrough.<BR>I NEED to learn of what, or who, is in that black emptiness. To know how Dreams work, where they go, how they gain knowledge. To know what is real and what isn't.<BR>To know the Truth.
Dream of emptiness.
