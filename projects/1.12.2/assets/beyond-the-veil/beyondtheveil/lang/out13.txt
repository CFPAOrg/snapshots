See thee later, dude.
Oi, dost thou knoweth what a SHOGGOTH is?
Yes, I do. 
Enlighten me. 
Oh. |I'm sorry, really. |:That is not a knowledge borne lightly.
I beg of thee, friend. :Don't trust the Shoggoth. Thou will regret it.
It was that voice in thy head that told ya how to make one, eh?
What voice? 
Yes. 
Oh no I'm not doin' that. :Thou art lucky enough as it is, my dude.
Yet I fear that that voice in thy head will, sooner or later, tell thee how to make one.
What voice? 
Tell me more. 
Remember when ya were baptised and then breathed HARD in a voice that wasn't thine? :Heh.
See thee later, dude.
§5§oWhen I gaze at the horrors before me, all I have left is to weep.
§5§oYou are lucky, master, in your ignorance of what lies Beyond.
§5§oMaster, the water you put in my brain.. it's agonizing, yet the pain is not of physical nature.
§5§oEverything is so meaningless.. you'll see, once you dip your head in water.
§5§oMaster.. I beg of you.. rip my spine. Make me whole.
§5§oI cannot *see* the world around me, yet I *know* it, even better than you do, Master. And it is most horrid.
§5§oYou baptized me Master.. you are holy, a god among worms.
§5§oI hear whispers.. please.. somebody.. stop them...
§5§oI Dreamt of you. You were laughing, but not of joy. Your eyes were hollow.
§5§oThe world is beautiful. Like an Ocean of tears.
§5§oSplish splash. Heehee.
§5§oI am whole.
§5§oI see beautiful shapes.. transparent and fluid, like a watery surface.
§5§oI see a pocket of red at the bottom of the Ocean, like a ruby within a diamond.
§5§oI Dreamt of a beautiful rainbow. It was red.
§5§oMy Dreams colour the world! I am sure, because your face is red, heehee.
§5§oThe Crawling Chaos whispered to me. He said I'm his favourite, heehee!
§5§oMaster! Master! I have a secret that I wish to share!
§5§oMaster.. I can share a terrible, terrible secret with you.
§5§oAll I ask in return is for you to promise to grant me a wish, a single wish. Speak to me again if you accept.
