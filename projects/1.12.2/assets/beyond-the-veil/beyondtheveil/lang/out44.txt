Craft a Dream Focus.
Curtains
Curtains are our world's counterpart to the Veil. Separating Truth from lies, behind them act a stageful of actors.<BR>Yes, maybe our reality is really nothing but a theatre.<BR>Still, these curtains I mean to make are a fair deal more mundane. They'll simply act as filters for the items that collide with them.
Curtains act as filters for Dreams, just like the Veil. Some go through, some don't.<BR>In this case it's the Fleti's Dreams and the items they transport that may or may not pass.<BR>A Curtain must be placed under a container, such as a chest. Every time an item goes through, the Curtain checks whether the inventory above contains an instance of that item. If so, the item doesn't go through and stops floating, dropping instead to the ground or, preferably, to an aptly placed hopper.<BR>Having containers both above and below, with appropriate spacing between them to avoid all items being sucked in hoppers, makes for a fairly space-consuming setup, but one that can work well as a sorting system.

Dream Focus: Fluids
We should not stop at items! Fleti are more than capable of transporting other things.<BR>A Focus for Fluids would be a useful device.
Unlike its item counterpart, a Focus for Fluids plucks fluids from its top and ejects them from its bottom, which is where I'll be when starting to set the path.<BR>Fleti are to be placed on the device's sides, and up to four of them can be placed. Each one increases the amount of fluid transported at a time, in the order 100 -> 300 -> 600 -> 1000 millibuckets per go.<BR>Transported fluids will try to enter any tanks they come in contact with, and will disappear at the end of the path if no containers were found to store them.<BR>It is of note that Fleti that are "fueling" a Dream Focus of any kind will not prevent nearby Weepers or other Fleti from weeping into a Lacrymatory, thus making the Fluid Focus an appropriate method to empty Lacrymatories automatically.<BR>As a last note, floating water also appears to be a powerful fertiliser for nearby crops.
