Ignorance. |Yes, maybe that is it. | :Without knowledge, you make assumptions.[ Dangerous ones.
Why don't you relieve yourself of your prejudice, outsider, and let me tell you how things truly went?
All of you just:dismissed me with the:very same prejudice you:are now accusing me of.
...truth is, outsider..  we are afraid. |:Terribly afraid of ones like you. Ours isn't prejudice as much as it is wariness, justified suspiciousness.
If you truly want to fight prejudice, then why don't you listen to me, and let me tell how things truly went?
So, traveller, what'll it be? Will you listen now to our story?
Fine.:Go ahead.
Not now.
There are many Hamlets like ours in this world, although not as many as there once were. But they've all got something in common.
You may have been turned off initially by the blackness and dampness of the surrounding territory, but everytime you see it, it means that at one point in time a Hamlet like ours stood there.
The ground wasn't always like this, though. :Contrary to what some may think, we didn't settle here because of any appeal the soil had upon us. :In fact, we are the very reason the ground became so.
It was our worship of our Deity that made it happen, and if that doesn't prove its realness, then I don't know what will.:Unfortunately, many of[ your ancestors] did not like the idea of a god truer than theirs.
In fact they were so disgusted at the idea of a deity turning the ground black and damp that they deemed us 'heretics', and started hunting us down.[ One by one.]
{Our homes were burned, our people slaughtered.} Our fathers, the survivors, lost everything. It was a{ massacre.}{ It was a[ GENOCIDE].
And they deemed themselves "Saints" and "Hunters", those{ merciless murderers.
But we had friends. Powerful friends, who pulled the war away from us, and upon themselves. Oh, and if it wasn't for them, our whole people would've been{ eradicated.
