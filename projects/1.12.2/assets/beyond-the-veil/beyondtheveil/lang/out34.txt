Craft a Statue of Sacrifice.
Statue of Penitence
I have sinned. I have sinned.<BR>In my arrogance I forgot my insignificance.<BR>I must right these wrongs. With blood.<BR>My own.<BR>I will build a new Statue, one that shows my regret.
This feels more.. right.<BR>I wanted to play God, despite being so, so tiny. It's only right that I suffer some punishment.<BR>The Statue of Penitence does everything the normal Statue does, though it takes slighty more crawlers to achieve the same power.<BR>However, when I'm under its effects, I am reminded of my own flaws, my failures, my weaknesses.<BR>With a Sacrificial Knife, I will cut myself while wielding a sword in the main hand, for I've always been weak.<BR>I will cut when I wield a shovel, an axe, a pickaxe, for I've always been slow.<BR>Even the hoe.. for the green thumb I never had.<BR>When the worshippers are enough, even the Crown of Thorns may become easier to use.<BR>The way of pain is an arduous one, yet not impossible.<BR>All it takes is a little Sacrifice.

Statue of Valour
There is no such thing as Valour.<BR>And even if there were, I'd be no paragon.<BR>This research is a dead end.
Altar of Sacrifice
I revel in limitless gratitude towards my Patron, yet in agony.<BR>For there is no way I can duly offer Him my thanks.<BR>Or is there?<BR>Blood makes for powerful bonds. It is water and life, all at once.<BR>It is the link that binds all things living to the deepest oceans.<BR>Through blood shall I thank Him, through life and water.<BR>An Altar of Sacrifice, of Hearts and Prismarine.<BR>First, a core.
I must build a structure, as described below. The hearts will be expended for every sacrifice. I can interact with bare hands with the Core to make sure it's been built correctly.<BR>A heartless villager is to be placed upon the Core. He'll expire in seconds. Then, a boon.<BR>My offerings will be rewarded. Dropping items on the altar before the sacrifice might turn them into something else.<BR>For instance, stone bricks become blood in color and essence. A new resource, one of unknown properties.<BR>A sacrifice without valid offerings will result in a health boost.<BR>I thank You, Great Dreamer, with all my hearts.
