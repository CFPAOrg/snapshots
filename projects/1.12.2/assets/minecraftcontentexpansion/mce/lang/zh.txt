Stone Age
First Tool
You first need to get some flint, plant fiber and sticks to craft your first primitive tool:\nthe flint hatchet.
Better Tools
As you may already noticed breaking stone will give you small rocks instead of the full block.\n\nUse 4 rocks to craft 2 cobblestone.
You can also use the rocks to craft stone tool heads and with them craft stone tools.
Torch
Kiln
The Kiln is a oven that is used to process clay and to craft cement.\nIt can also produce charcoal.
Chopping Block
The chopping block can be used to effectively process wood. So for example you can make planks and slabs.\nSimply punch the wood with your axe to process it.
Metal Age
Getting ingots
To smelt ores into ingots you need a smelter.\nCrafting the smelter requires cement which can be produced with the kiln. 
The Smelter needs heat to process ores.\nIs the heat under 3/4 the smelter will stop processing and you need to burn some coal.
Industrial Age
Produce Energy
A simple way to produce energy is by burning coal.
You can also gain energy with solar power.
Store Energy
Craft a battery to store up to 200000 FE.
