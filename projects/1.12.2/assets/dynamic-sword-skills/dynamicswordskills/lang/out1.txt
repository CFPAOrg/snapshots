SKILL DESCRIPTION
SUMMARY
Sword skills are acquired by finding and using skill orbs, and all sword skills first require knowledge of the Basic Sword Technique.\nBy default, a basic skill orb is granted upon first joining a world; more may be acquired either through exploration or combat.\nEvery skill is activated in a unique fashion, and each use adds a certain amount of exhaustion. Like any other strenuous activity, physical combat requires lots of energy.\nExhaustion is part of the vanilla hunger mechanic - please see the online Wiki for more information. As a reference, a normal attack adds 0.3 exhaustion.

Back Slice

Quickly circle around and hit 'em where it hurts!\nSome enemies are more vulnerable to attacks from behind, and many have a small chance to lose any equipped chest armor. Higher tiers of armor are harder to knock off, even harder if enchanted with Unbreaking; Sharpness weapons gain a bonus to disarmor.\nNote that attacking too early, too late, or not from behind will only result in a standard attack.
