Place a bedrock above an activated beacon leaving a space of 1 block in between. Now bring the beacon into an explosion. Stand back, it's crushing with a big BOOM unless stabilized. (See Bedrock Rose)
Place the Empty Rift on top of the Bedrock-Well in the End while the Ender-Dragon is still alive and no Ender-Crystals have been destroyed. It will then charge up.
