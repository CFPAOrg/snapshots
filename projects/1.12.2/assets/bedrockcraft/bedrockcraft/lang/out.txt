Right-Click a Void-Beacon in the overworld to get a GUI where you can produce powerful tools. You can put components, enchanted books and void ingots in to create a very unique tool.
If you jump out of the world holding this strange totem, you can pass the void and discover a new world. IMPORTANT: Bring 12 ender-eyes because you'll need to find an end-portal in that world to leave it.
Under the top bedrock layer there are many void ores. They can be mined with a diamon pickaxe but it'll take very long. The void beacons are found on top of huge bedrock pillars. They can also be mined with a diamon pickaxe.
Place the breaker on top of a bedrock. Itll need a fairly big amount of energy to break the bedrock and drop on it's top.
By building a structure with that block you may create bedrock without having to use the breaker all the time. But it'll end up in an explosion if not stabilized. (See Bedrock Rose)
The generator takes ender-pearls and origin-pearls to create a huge amount of energy for one minute. But as it's not capable of saving that energy everything that is not used will disappear. It produces FE and EU (Insane Voltage)
You can spawn a bedrock-golem. It's the only way to obtain some bedrock roses. But remember: You can only damage it with a bedrock pickaxe.
Sometimes voidic power is released and things explode. You can stabilize that with four roses around the block and four ender-rifts on top. But if it's built wrong, BOOM. So be careful.
