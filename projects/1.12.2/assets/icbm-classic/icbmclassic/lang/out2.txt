Antimatter Minecart
Red Matter Minecart
Slightly more destructive version of TNT
Erupts in a barrage of metal fragments
Catches the place on fire
Confusion and disorientation for all around
Can't fight if you can't breathe
What's up doc
Pushes everyone away
Pulls everyone in
Devastates the landscape with high velocity fragments
Have you ever heard of the plague?
Who needs to be a ninja to sneak in after that much noise?
When you need a door
Mini-nuke in a can. Or at least as close as the North can get
Hi! I'm a nuclearholic..
Over 9000? Not anymore
You thought the sun was hot
They call me Mr. Freeze
I think your base looks better floating
Let's relocate that base of yours
I feel bad for your ears

Yogscast? Diggy diggy hole
Be a shame if your base was compacted into nothing
Voltz special... The Bomb
The wheels on the bus go round and round
Did a cow just fly by the window?
Oh god it's sucking me in
There is no escape
Not even light....
Into the void
Oh? You think you can escape
Oh baby come back
