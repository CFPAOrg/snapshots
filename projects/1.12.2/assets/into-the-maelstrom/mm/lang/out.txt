Herobrine out!
What a fine being we have here! I must investigate!
Come join our empire as a maelstrom zombie!
Die pesky specimen!
We've been having a problem with the maelstrom that's invaded this dimension.
You seem like a warrior, would you defeat the maelstrom invaders for us?
We'll reward you handsomely for taking out the maelstrom.
Have a look around the mineshaft for any useful gear and items.
Under the maelstrom growths, there is a core that spawns the maelstrom. Remove those!
Keep an eye out for the maelstrom fortress. That's where the boss is.
Pleb, have no mana! Get some maelstrom minotaur horns, and I'll get you started.
Good, that catalyst will unlock your mana.
Any staff uses a certain amount of mana.
Mana will slowly refill over time.
Slaying the maelstrom will also restore mana. Bosses will fill your entire bar!
Be careful of enemies that drain your mana. Now good luck, apprentice!
That's a good starter gun. First time shooting?
I'll explain to refresh your memory anyways.
Guns need to be reloaded after every shot.
They will automatically reload in your hand.
Guns require ammo, so keep plenty on you.
I personally use cases of ammo. Why you ask?
Because guns require megatons of ammo!
Watch out for modded armors. Some are scams!
In what way you ask? I'll share my research.
Armor points past 20, a full diamond suit, do not actually matter!
This is because the damage calculation caps armor at 20 even if the armor is stronger.
My armor is different. It uses maelstrom armor to become stronger than diamond.
So always buy from your trusted armorer!
