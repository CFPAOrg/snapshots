Congrats! You have reached the ending. See the mod page for more details.
Give to herobrine to craft
You over there. You look like an adventurer.
If you get me some pearls, I'll give you something good.
Come on, there's no need for violence.
Thanks! Now, let me try to kill you.
I just want to see how strong you are for fun.
Fascinating. I guess you can fight.
Maybe instead of killing you, you can be my slave.
If you find any key fragments, give them to me, and I'll craft another key.
That way, I can unlock the way to those annoying maelstrom generals.
And you can do your exploration or whatever. Everybody wins.
Pipe down, the battle's over.
Do you have fragments for the next key? If not, then GTFO.
Don't attack me you dweeb. Only I'm allowed to attack unprovoked.
Not bad. Now go get some more fragments for me.
Do you have fragments for the next key? If not, then GTFO.
How about you go left click some maelstrom instead?
Try taking on this dimension. I'm sure it won't be that bad.
Guess you're too stupid to see that I'm ignoring you.
Fantastic. You've proved very handy, but
I'll be doing the rest. I can't let you have all the fun.
