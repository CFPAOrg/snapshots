Output liquid
Advanced Chemical Reactor is a highly-advanced machine that is capable to allow many chemical reaction happen inside of it. \nIt has 5 input slots, 5 output slots, individual cell input/output slot and a reaction module slot.
Air Pump is a machine that can produce high-pressure air. Place one of it below Liquefier will automatically supply Liquefier with high-pressure air. 
Pyrolyzer can use extreme amount of heat to decompose several substances. \nPower requirement is vary on recipes. 
Liquefier can convert high-pressure air into liquefied air. It requires an Air Pump below it in order to get air supply.
Condense Tower is a multiblock structure that can separate liquid mixture into several pure liquid, based on differences among boiling point of liquids.
