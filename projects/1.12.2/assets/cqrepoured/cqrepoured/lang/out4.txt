Lich Phylactery
Wear the spider to become the spider. A full set allows you to climb walls and jump much higher.
Flowing forth from the fangs that made this simple sword a hero's blade, Shelob's poison can't be stayed once your foe is stuck with this blade.
Wear the bull to become the bull. A full set allows you to charge forward at great speed, and destroy anything in your path.
Hold right click to strike a large area.
The turtle's power, should you fashion a full set from its shell, will allow you to regain health much faster. The shell prevents most damage from the rear, as well.
With a full set of the regenerating goo touching your skin, you can feel your maximum health overflowing, and whenever you are damaged, a small slime may appear which can restore your health, if you can reach it.
Those who tread to the angels song the prophets say can do no wrong. A single leap becomes a bound, a brisk walk breaks the speed of sound, no fall can stop the chosen few, and with these boots, that includes you. 
You can feel the power of the dragon coursing through your veins. Attacks that once were a threat to you seem meaningless now, yet your own strikes are twice as strong!
Right click while moving to leap forward
Right click while moving to leap forward. They say the wielder of this dagger could, at will, vanish without a trace. You can probably mimic this behavior with a sneaking right-click, but while you'll vanish from sight, you won't go far. 
Grux right-click ground. Make earthquake. Travel forward. Smash enemies real good. Grux like.
