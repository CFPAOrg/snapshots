Lich Phylactery
Wear the spider to become the spider. A full set allows you to climb walls and jump much higher.
Flowing forth from the fangs that made this simple sword a hero's blade, Shelob's poison can't be stayed once your foe is stuck with this blade.
Wear the bull to become the bull. A full set allows you to charge forward at great speed, and destroy anything in your path.
Hold right click to strike a large area.
The turtle's power, should you fashion a full set from its shell, will allow you to regain health much faster. The shell prevents most damage from the rear, as well.
With a full set of the regenerating goo touching your skin, you can feel your maximum health overflowing, and whenever you are damaged, a small slime may appear which can restore your health, if you can reach it.
Those who tread to the angels song the prophets say can do no wrong. A single leap becomes a bound, a brisk walk breaks the speed of sound, no fall can stop the chosen few, and with these boots, that includes you. 
You can feel the power of the dragon coursing through your veins. Attacks that once were a threat to you seem meaningless now, yet your own strikes are twice as strong!
Right click while moving to leap forward
Right click while moving to leap forward. They say the wielder of this dagger could, at will, vanish without a trace. You can probably mimic this behavior with a sneaking right-click, but while you'll vanish from sight, you won't go far. 
Grux right-click ground. Make earthquake. Travel forward. Smash enemies real good. Grux like.
Legend has it that any who fired an arrow upon the walker king would find a sword in their back and the king behind them. Perhaps collecting both his sword and his shield would allow you the same ability?
Click right click to fire, requires bullets.

A mystical object created by an ancient race. Hold Right click to set a position, then do it again to teleport there. Sneak while holding Right-click to remove the saved location.
Current Position:
The flames consume those who cross your path, a simple right-click and they'll feel your wrath. Also lights torches.
Right-click to shoot your goo, my dude.
It's a gun on a stick. Man, those dwarves are geniuses.
A left-click restores the health that you need, I don't actually remember what this does, but I had to make descriptions for all of these out of greed.
Contains:
Empty
Left-click a mob to store it, right-click to summon that mob. Can be put in a single use spawner so that spawner spawns the stored mob.
Undertech Prototype Fyrebird mk7 22mm nozzle flame expulsion unit. A right-mouse press should expel fire directly forwards. Internal Gel Cartridges should be able to extract slime from anywhere in the inventory. Current model requires regular reload, as no regenerating source of slime has been discovered. 
Creative only item. Right-click with it to open a GUI, items placed in this GUI can be accessed later by left-clicking any mob with this badge again, and will be dropped when the attached mob is killed.
Right-click to open.

The inscription on the blade reads "My power can only be awakened in the light of the moon"

This rod radiates dark energy, as you hold it in your hand. If you move it near your ear, you will hear its demand. Its call is simple: "Right-click with me" and when you do then you will see, a projectile it does emit. Though the damage is slight, if you land it just right, it will heal you when it does hit. 
Whatever this is supposed to do, it doesn't work yet. #TODO

A well-made weapon with longer reach than swords. Right-click to charge an extended thrust.
Mob to be summoned:
A rough approximation of what a shield is supposed to look like. Will not protect you from attacks. An exported dummy that is holding this will instead be holding the usual shield for its mob type when its dungeon generates.
