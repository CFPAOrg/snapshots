This is not a condenser; there must be no condenser tubes it to form
There must be two sets of rotor bearings in opposing walls of the turbine for it to form
The walls housing the rotor bearings must be square for the turbine to form
Inlets and outlets must be installed opposite each other on the walls housing the rotor bearings for the turbine to form
The sets of rotor bearings must be square and centred in the middle of each opposing wall for the turbine to form
The rotor shaft must be fully connected to each set of rotor bearings for the turbine to form
The space between the sets of rotor blades and stators must be empty for the turbine to form
The rotor blades or stators about each section of the rotor shaft must be of the same type for the turbine to form
Each section of the rotor shaft must have rotor blades or stators of the same type extend fully to the wall for the turbine to form
There are %s qubits connected to this quantum computer; there can only be %s at most for it to form
