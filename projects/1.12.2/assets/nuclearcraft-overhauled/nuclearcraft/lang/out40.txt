Fusion Configs
Configure aspects of nuclear fusion.
Power Gen Multiplier
Modifies the power generated by fusion reactors.
Fuel Use Multiplier
Modifies the rate of fuel used by fusion reactors.
Heat Gen Multiplier
Modifies the heat generated by fusion reactors while running.
Heating Rate Multiplier
Modifies the heating rate of fusion reactors before running.
Enable Meltdowns
Can fusion reactors overheat?
Meltdown Radiation Multiplier
Modifies the radiation leaked by meltdowns.
Enable Fusion Active Cooling
Can fusion reactors be actively cooled (disable if suffering from lag)?
Active Cooling Rates
Base heat removed per tick/mB. Order: water, redstone, quartz, gold, glowstone, lapis, diamond, liquid helium, ender, cryotheum, iron, emerald, copper, tin, magnesium.
