Hold down the control key rather than the shift key to show extra tooltip info?
JEI Chance Output Display
Will the chance item output cycle in JEI include empty stacks if a possible output stack size is 0? If false, a minimum stack size of 1 shall be shown - although some info about the recipe is lost this way, it looks much neater. This will only effect the outputs in JEI and not the actual functioning of the machines.
Enable Rare Drops
Will mobs drop rare items?
Enable Dungeon Loot
Will NuclearCraft loot generate in chests?
Enable Ore Dict Raw Material Recipes
Will Ore Dictionary inputs be used for 'ingot <-> block' crafting and 'dust -> ingot' furnace recipes? If false, the NC ingredient will be used.
Enable Ore Dict Mod Priority
Will Ore Dictionary outputs be prioritised according to the mod list below? If false, the default Ore Dict entry will be used when deciding machine outputs.
Ore Dict Mod Priority
Determines the priority of each mod's ore dictionary entries - earlier mods' IDs in this list have a higher priority. This is used to determine which mod's corresponding item is produced in machine recipes. If no matching mod is found, the default entry is used.
