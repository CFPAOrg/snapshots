Heavy Water Moderator
Fission Reactor Moderator
Flux Factor: %s
Efficiency Multiplier: %s
Moderators are the medium through which one fission reactor cell/vessel sends neutron flux to another or itself. A moderator line consists of EITHER at most %s collimated moderators with a cell/vessel at one endpoint and a cell/vessel at the other OR at most %s collimated moderators with a cell/vessel at one endpoint and a neutron reflector at the other. Moderators are only considered 'active' if part of a line AND adjacent to at least one functional endpoint cell/vessel. A primed or functional cell/vessel sends flux down the line, either to be accepted by the other cell/vessel or to be sent back by the reflector. The total flux sent is the sum of flux factors of the moderators in the line. This is doubled in the case of reflection, and is multiplied by the reflector's reflectivity factor. Finally, the total efficiency of the cells at the line endpoints is multiplied by the mean efficiency of the lines it receives flux from - the efficiency of a line is the mean efficiency multiplier of the moderators in the line.

Reduces the radiation level of the chunk it is placed in. Its effectiveness depends on the amount of free space around it. Alone, it will remove a maximum of %s of the radiation in its chunk at %s efficiency, though the collective contribution from all scrubbers in the chunk will stack non-linearly. The radiation level will fall approximately linearly at first, but eventually doubly exponentially in the limit of many scrubbers. The efficiency and required power depends on the rad-clearing agent being used.
