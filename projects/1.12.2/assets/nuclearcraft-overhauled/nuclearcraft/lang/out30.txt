Geiger Counter
Detects radiation and informs the player of their rad count. Can be used to read the irradiation of entities. Will be muted if off the hotbar.
Radiation:
Light Radiation Shielding
Medium Radiation Shielding
Heavy Radiation Shielding
Can be applied to armor to give the player %s rad resistance while worn.
Can be applied to armor to give the player %s rad resistance while worn. Can also be applied to containers to shield against irradiation from its contents.
