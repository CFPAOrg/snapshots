Electromagnet Power
RF/t required to keep an electromagnet active.
Heat Exchanger Configs
Configure aspects of heat exchangers.
Minimum Structure Length
Minimum side length of heat exchangers.
Maximum Structure Length
Maximum side length of heat exchangers.
Tube Conductivity
Multiplier for heat transfer rate to and from this type of tube. For heat exchanging tubes, heating recipes will be faster by this factor while cooling recipes will be slower by this factor. For condensation tubes, recipes will simply be faster by this factor. Order: copper, hard carbon, thermoconducting alloy.
Coolant Heat Multiplier
Multiplier for the heat required to cool hot coolant.
Alternate Exhaust Steam Recipe
Will exhaust steam be heated into standard steam rather than low pressure steam?
Turbine Configs
Configure aspects of turbines.
Minimum Structure Length
Minimum side length of turbines.
Maximum Structure Length
Maximum side length of turbines.
Rotor Blade Efficiency
Multiplier for the energy transferred from the fluid flow to this type of rotor blade. Order: steel, extreme alloy, SiC-SiC CMC.
Rotor Blade Expansion Coefficient
Coefficient by which a set of this type of rotor blade multiplies the volume of the fluid in the oncoming flow. Order: steel, extreme alloy, SiC-SiC CMC.
