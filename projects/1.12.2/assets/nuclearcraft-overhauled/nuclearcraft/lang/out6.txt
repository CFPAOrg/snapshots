Reduces the radiation level of the chunk it is placed in. Its effectiveness depends on the amount of free space around it. Alone, it will remove a maximum of %s of the radiation in its chunk at %s efficiency, though the collective contribution from all scrubbers in the chunk will stack non-linearly. The radiation level will fall approximately linearly at first, but eventually doubly exponentially in the limit of many scrubbers. The efficiency and required power depends on the rad-clearing agent being used.
