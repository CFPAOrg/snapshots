Slow-Acting RadAway Rad Removal Rate
The rate at which rads is removed when using Slow-Acting RadAway in Rad/t.
Rad Poisoning Time
The time taken for a dose of radiation poisoning to be added to the player's rad count in ticks.
RadAway Cooldown Time
The time that must be waited between doses of RadAway in ticks.
Rad-X Rad Resistance
Controls the amount of rad resistance gained when consuming Rad-X.
Rad-X Lifetime
The time taken for one dose of Rad-X to wear off in ticks.
Rad-X Cooldown Time
The time that must be waited between doses of Rad-X in ticks.
Radiation Shielding Levels
The rad resistance levels provided by the three levels of shielding. Order: light, medium, heavy.
Radiation Container Shielding
If enabled along with hardcore containers, radiation shielding can be applied to tile entities.
Radiation Hazmat Shielding
The rad resistance levels provided by each piece of the hazmat suit. Order: headwear, chestpiece, leggings, boots.
Scrubber Max Removal Rate
The maximum rate at which a 100% efficiency scrubber will remove radiation as a fraction of the radiation level of the chunk it is in. Only applies when using linear scrubbing mechanics.
Scrubber Search Radius
The range of scrubbers' search for occluding blocks.
Non-linear Scrubber Mechanics
Use a non-linear scrubbing rate equation instead of the linear behaviour?
Non-linear Scrubber Parameters
Scrubber Recipe Lifetime
The lifetime in ticks of one item or 250 mB of fluid in an active scrubber. Order: borax dust, RadAway, Slow-Acting RadAway
Scrubber Recipe Power Use
The power in RF/t scrubbers need to be supplied to run with these ingredients. Order: borax dust, RadAway, Slow-Acting RadAway
Scrubber Recipe Efficiency
The efficiency multiplier of an active scrubber using these ingredients. Order: borax dust, RadAway, Slow-Acting RadAway
