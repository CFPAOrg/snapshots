Structure Background Radiation
List of structures and their background radiation levels. These values stack with the underlying world or biome's background radiation. Format: 'structureName_radiationLevel'.
World Radiation Limit
List of dimensions and their radiation level limits. Format: 'dimID_radiationLimit'.
Biome Radiation Limit
List of biomes and their radiation level limits. These values stack with the underlying world's background radiation. Format: 'modid:biomeName_radiationLimit'.
Biome Radiation Dimension Blacklist
List of IDs of dimensions to blacklist for biome background radiation.
Ore Stack Radiation
List of ore dict entries and their stack radiation levels. Can be used to overwrite default values. Can use Unix-style wildcards for the ore name. Format: 'oreName_radiationLevel'.
Item Stack Radiation
List of items and their stack radiation levels. Can be used to overwrite default values. Format: 'modid:name:meta_radiationLevel'.
Block Stack Radiation
List of blocks and their radiation levels. Can be used to overwrite default values. Format: 'modid:name:meta_radiationLevel'.
Fluid Stack Radiation
List of fluids and their radiation levels. Can be used to overwrite default values. If the fluid has a corresponding block, then it will also be given a radiation level. Format: 'fluidName_radiationLevel'.
Food Radiation and Resistance
List of foods and the rads and rad resistance gained on consumption. Negative values mean rads and rad resistance will be lost. Can be used to overwrite default values. Format: 'modid:name:meta_radiationLevel_radiationResistance'.
Ore Stack Radiation Blacklist
List of ore dict entries that will be forced not have a radiation level. Can use Unix-style wildcards for the ore name. Format: 'oreName'.
Item Stack Radiation Blacklist
List of items that will be forced not have a radiation level. Format: 'modid:name:meta'.
