After much trial and error, I've finally succeeded. By infusing a seed of pure void with ancient stone, arcane glyphs, the plates to make a helm, and an eye with uncanny mobility, along with the appropriate quantities of essentia, I can call a creature forth from the void. The resulting Eldritch Crab may not exactly match the creature described in the Crimson Rites, but it should be close enough for my purposes.<BR>Despite my success here, I doubt it's possible to replicate the procedure for any other entities. According to my previous research, even this much should be impossible. I have an uneasy feeling that something else may have interceded to ensure I was able to release these creatures into the world.
Erythurgy
It's always been obvious that the Crimson Cult uses a different sort of magic from the thaumaturgy I've grown accustomed to. Now, with further translations done, I may be able to figure out exactly what it is.<BR>The Crimson Rites refer to it as erythurgy, or "red magic," and what I've deciphered so far seems simplistic to say the least. Erythurgy recognizes six "elements," which bear a striking resemblance to the six primal aspects. Perhaps I should experiment further with them.
Erythurgy is inelegant, to say the least, resembling a very basic form of thaumaturgy which requires little to no understanding of magical principles. Where thaumaturgy requires intelligence and practice, erythurgy makes use of magical brute force: suffusing items with vast quantities of primal aspects in often-wasteful manners to transform them in some way.<BR>Still, despite its inelegance, erythurgy seems able to accomplish a few interesting things I've overlooked. My research into the "elemental" aspects has borne little fruit, but I've found some ways to make use of Perditio and Ordo, even if they are a bit wasteful compared to my other discoveries. Perhaps I can find a way to improve on these processes in the future.
