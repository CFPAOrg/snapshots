§4Deprived of a body, the heart throbs in your hand.
The Golden Thread needs more space
§6Walls have been broken. Walls that were limiting.
§6The mind has been reforged, and next is the body.
§6The body has been reforged. The skin felt like clay, but it hardened.
§6Ecstasy spreads, but will sooner wayne. But it always wants to leave something... contentment, ideally.
§6The earth revolves around the sun, and it never stops existing... but on times, we won't see it, and these times are times of dread.
§6As the sun is not seen, darkness arises. The darkness consumes, the darkness spreads fear.
§6And as the mind gets used to the fear, suddenly it stops. And as it stops, all sound stops.
§6And suddenly we laugh.
§6The fire roars and so does my soul... and I shall burn forever.
§6The water flows, the water feels... and the water feels me.
§6The air swirls and I swirl with it...  and the harmony persists.
§6The heart moves, the world moves... and I am the center.
§6The fabric was stitched and so was I... and I am a masterpiece.
§6I am me... not the true me, but less of a lie.
§6I persisted... and I will persist.
§6My walls hold my sanity in, but keep the knowledge out... and my walls crumble.
§6The fabric was stitched... but I was the string.
§6The Great Dreamer sleeps... but I have awoken.
§6Dragons don't roar, they sing... and the world shall hear me.
