Focus Effect: Stabilize
My recent discoveries have shown that stabilizing abnormalities in infusion matrices is indeed possible. <BR>I should invest research in creating an according focus effect.
This stabilization effect will (when cast on an Infusion Matrix) increase the target's stability for a bit.<BR>This could be useful in some infusions.

Recently, I started experiments with intoxicating herbs... relatively expensive intoxicating herbs.<BR>I could invest research into finding a cheap way of short intoxication.<BR>Maybe I should start by looking at a familiar fungus, one that already has minor intoxicating effects.
Inspecting these mushrooms has proven useful; however, I will need to investigate further, and find ways of enhancing this fungus' properties.<BR>Examining rather occult manifestations of the mind will prove useful.
I have completed my research.<BR>This modified fungus will intoxicate anyone that touches it, for a short period of time.<BR>It's quite smelly.

Focus Effect: Close Rifts
Now that I have found a way of removing flux rifts, I should invest into reducing the cost of doing so.<BR>A focus would be optimal.
This focus is able of closing rifts matching its power at the cost of flux (which can be decreased). <BR>Removing flux rifts with the pure power of a focus seems to have its downsides. The destroyed rift won't drop any useful objects and will just disappear.
