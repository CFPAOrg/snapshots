Elementaristics
The Elementaristics
As I think about it... the knowledge of this book could be useful with my research on the Elementaristics, yet another school of magic.<BR>I will need another book for this work.
Essence Creation
I sense potential support for the creation of elementaristic essences. However, I will need to invest some time in research.
My research was successful!<BR>I can now create essences with a template, a "Blank Essence". This template closely resembles the structure of elementaristic essences and has an affinity for simple reactions.<LINE><PAGE>In order to create a Blank Essence, I will need to obtain Quartz and Chaotic Matter, matter that was through some alchemical reactions. Blank Essences may be transformed into other essences, depending on how I manipulate them.
Creating Fire Essence
Creating Water Essence
Creating Earth Essence
Creating Air Essence
Creating Aether Essence
Creating Light Essence
Creating Ice Essence
Creating Life Essence
Creating Crystal Essence
I could perform some experiments to find another way of creating this essence.
The experiments were successful. I have added the recipe to this entry.
Material Studies: Maganized Matter
I could enhance my repertoire of materials by studying a rather unconventional material...Maganized Matter. <BR> While it seems like a bad idea to use a material of such weirdly definable consistency, golems made out of it seem stable. <BR>Furthermore, these golems are incredibly light, yet they are more durable and stronger than other lightweight golems.
