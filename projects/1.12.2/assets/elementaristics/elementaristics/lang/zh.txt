§6The heart unfolds in the weave to show a Magan Soul influence!
§bHere, the heart is the feather which it is weighted against. Here is an Air Soul influence.
§2As the heart spots an Earth Soul influence, it feels like it is one of stone once again.
§1The blood of the heart jumps and flows as it spots a Water Soul influence.
§cThe heart beats stronger than it did before as it spots a Fire Soul influence.
§dThe heart is a skull and the heart is a string. This is a Mana Soul influence.
§4The heart falls apart but is then rethought in the influence of an Unstable Soul!
§7The heart stops beating, but it will not die either, as it is in a Immutable Soul influence.
§fThe heart is awash with vitality as it sports a Balanced Soul influence!
§eThe heart sings a song that should not be heard in this world.
§0The heart spots a force of the ancient, a force that should not be found in the world.
§3This place is not a part of this world. This place serves something else.
§9This place feels.
§8This is not a place, this is a machine.
§fThe Garden?
§fThe Thought?
§4The Legacy?
§4Deprived of a body, the heart throbs in your hand.
The Golden Thread needs more space
§6Walls have been broken. Walls that were limiting.
§6The mind has been reforged, and next is the body.
§6The body has been reforged. The skin felt like clay, but it hardened.
§6Ecstasy spreads, but will sooner wayne. But it always wants to leave something... contentment, ideally.
§6The earth revolves around the sun, and it never stops existing... but on times, we won't see it, and these times are times of dread.
§6As the sun is not seen, darkness arises. The darkness consumes, the darkness spreads fear.
§6And as the mind gets used to the fear, suddenly it stops. And as it stops, all sound stops.
§6And suddenly we laugh.
§6The fire roars and so does my soul... and I shall burn forever.
§6The water flows, the water feels... and the water feels me.
§6The air swirls and I swirl with it...  and the harmony persists.
§6The heart moves, the world moves... and I am the center.
§6The fabric was stitched and so was I... and I am a masterpiece.
§6I am me... not the true me, but less of a lie.
§6I persisted... and I will persist.
§6My walls hold my sanity in, but keep the knowledge out... and my walls crumble.
§6The fabric was stitched... but I was the string.
§6The Great Dreamer sleeps... but I have awoken.
§6Dragons don't roar, they sing... and the world shall hear me.

The Elementaristics
As I think about it... the knowledge of this book could be useful with my research on the Elementaristics, yet another school of magic.<BR>I will need another book for this work.
Essence Creation
I sense potential support for the creation of elementaristic essences. However, I will need to invest some time in research.
My research was successful!<BR>I can now create essences with a template, a "Blank Essence". This template closely resembles the structure of elementaristic essences and has an affinity for simple reactions.<LINE><PAGE>In order to create a Blank Essence, I will need to obtain Quartz and Chaotic Matter, matter that was through some alchemical reactions. Blank Essences may be transformed into other essences, depending on how I manipulate them.

Creating Light Essence
Creating Ice Essence
Creating Life Essence
Creating Crystal Essence
I could perform some experiments to find another way of creating this essence.
The experiments were successful. I have added the recipe to this entry.
Material Studies: Maganized Matter
I could enhance my repertoire of materials by studying a rather unconventional material...Maganized Matter. <BR> While it seems like a bad idea to use a material of such weirdly definable consistency, golems made out of it seem stable. <BR>Furthermore, these golems are incredibly light, yet they are more durable and stronger than other lightweight golems.
Examine a piece of Maganized Matter
Maganized Matter
These golems are light, yet durable.
Material Studies: Protoplasm
Protoplasm is a sticky organic material capable of repairing itself.<BR>Is this a good idea? <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Maybe.
Examine a piece of Protoplasm
Protoplasm
These golems are organic...
Focus Effect: Stabilize
My recent discoveries have shown that stabilizing abnormalities in infusion matrices is indeed possible. <BR>I should invest research in creating an according focus effect.
This stabilization effect will (when cast on an Infusion Matrix) increase the target's stability for a bit.<BR>This could be useful in some infusions.
Shimmershroom
Recently, I started experiments with intoxicating herbs... relatively expensive intoxicating herbs.<BR>I could invest research into finding a cheap way of short intoxication.<BR>Maybe I should start by looking at a familiar fungus, one that already has minor intoxicating effects.
Inspecting these mushrooms has proven useful; however, I will need to investigate further, and find ways of enhancing this fungus' properties.<BR>Examining rather occult manifestations of the mind will prove useful.
I have completed my research.<BR>This modified fungus will intoxicate anyone that touches it, for a short period of time.<BR>It's quite smelly.
Examine Vishrooms
Examine Fabric of Passion
Examine Fabric of Reason
Stabilize
Stabilizes infusion matrices.
Intensity
Focus Effect: Close Rifts
Now that I have found a way of removing flux rifts, I should invest into reducing the cost of doing so.<BR>A focus would be optimal.
This focus is able of closing rifts matching its power at the cost of flux (which can be decreased). <BR>Removing flux rifts with the pure power of a focus seems to have its downsides. The destroyed rift won't drop any useful objects and will just disappear.
Close Rifts
Completely removes flux rifts at the cost of flux generation. No items will drop.
