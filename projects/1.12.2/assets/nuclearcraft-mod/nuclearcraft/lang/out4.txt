Molten Salt Reactor Controller
The heart of the reactor - one is needed in the wall for it to form.
Molten Salt Reactor Wall
Comprises the faces of the reactor structure.
Molten Salt Reactor Glass
Comprises the faces of the reactor structure.
Molten Salt Reactor Frame
Comprises the edges and corners of the reactor structure.
Molten Salt Reactor Beam
Used to connect otherwise disconnected parts of the reactor to the wall.
Molten Salt Reactor Vent
Used to move fuel and coolant in and out of the reactor. Will push to [accept from] accepting [pushing] vessels and heaters.
Molten Salt Fission Vessel
Where the molten salt nuclear fuel fissions and depletes. Place against another vessel while sneaking to copy across its side configuration.
Molten Salt Coolant Heater
Where the salt coolant is heated to cool the reactor. Coolants must obey their placement rules to have any effect. Place against another heater while sneaking to copy across its side configuration.
Molten Salt Reactor Moderator Housing
Increases the efficiency of adjacent active vessels.
Molten Salt Fuel Distributor
Placed in the wall of the reactor - will spread fuel to all vessels at a limited rate.
Molten Salt Depleted Fuel Retriever
Placed in the wall of the reactor - will take depleted fuel from all vessels at a limited rate.
Molten Salt Reactor Redstone Port
Used to turn the reactor on and off. The heat level of the reactor can be read with a comparator from this block.
Molten Salt Reactor Computer Port
Used to access the reactor via OpenComputers.
Heat Exchanger Controller
The heart of the exchanger - one is needed in the wall for it to form.
Heat Exchanger Shell
Comprises the faces of the exchanger structure.
Heat Exchanger Glass
Comprises the faces of the exchanger structure.
Heat Exchanger Frame
Comprises the edges and corners of the exchanger structure.
