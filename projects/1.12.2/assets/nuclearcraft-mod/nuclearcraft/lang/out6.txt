SiC-SiC CMC Turbine Rotor Blade
Efficiency Multiplier: %s
Expansion Coefficient: %s
Used to convert the energy of the oncoming fluid flow into rotational energy in the rotor shaft. The expansion coefficient is larger than unity, so the volume of the fluid flow will increase each time it passes through a set. Must be placed in complete sets of four coplanar groups extending from the turbine shaft to the wall. Each blade block can process up to %s of oncoming fluid.
Turbine Rotor Stator
Expansion Coefficient: %s
Used to increase the density of the oncoming fluid flow, which can increase the efficiency of the turbine by counteracting overexpansion generated by sets of rotor blades. Must be placed in complete sets of four coplanar groups extending from the turbine shaft to the wall.
Turbine Rotor Bearing
Connects the rotor shaft to the turbine wall and dynamo. Must cover the full area of each end of the shaft.
Magnesium Turbine Dynamo Coil
Must be adjacent to at least one Rotor Bearing Block.
Beryllium Turbine Dynamo Coil
Must be adjacent to at least one valid Magnesium Dynamo Coil.
Aluminum Turbine Dynamo Coil
Must be adjacent to at least one valid Dynamo Coil of any type other than Aluminum.
Gold Turbine Dynamo Coil
Must be adjacent to at least one valid Beryllium Dynamo Coil.
Copper Turbine Dynamo Coil
Must be adjacent to at least one valid Gold Dynamo Coil.
Silver Turbine Dynamo Coil
Must be adjacent to at least one valid Magnesium Dynamo Coil and one valid Gold Dynamo Coil.
