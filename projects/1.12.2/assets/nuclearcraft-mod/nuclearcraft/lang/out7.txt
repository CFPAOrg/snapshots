Radiation Scrubber
Reduces the radiation level of the chunk it is placed in. Its effectiveness is dependent on the amount of free space around it, removing a maximum of %s of the radiation in its chunk. The collective contribution from all scrubbers in the chunk will stack linearly. %s
Reduces the radiation level of the chunk it is placed in. Its effectiveness is dependent on the amount of free space around it. Alone, it will remove a maximum of %s of the radiation in its chunk, though the collective contribution from all scrubbers in the chunk will stack non-linearly. The radiation level will fall approximately linearly at first, but eventually doubly exponentially in the limit of many scrubbers. %s
Requires %s RF/t and %s Borax/s to run.
Requires %s RF/t to run.
