Smart Processor Input
Will a machine's valid inputs depend on the stacks already in its input slots as well as its possible recipes?
Passive Permeation
Will passive machines such as Active Coolers and Electromagnets spread their items, fluid and energy to adjacent passive machines?
Processor Particles
Will machines produce particle effects while running?
