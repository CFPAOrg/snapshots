Graphite Block
Graphite is only considered active if adjacent to at least one Reactor Cell. Active graphite increases a reactor's efficiency, but also produces some extra heat. For each graphite block the additional power generated is equal to %s, and the additional heat generated is equal to %s.
Beryllium Block
Beryllium is only considered active if adjacent to at least one Reactor Cell. Active beryllium increases a reactor's efficiency, but also produces some extra heat. For each beryllium block the additional power generated is equal to %s, and the additional heat generated is equal to %s.

Fission Reactor Moderator
Fission Reactor Casing
Used in the construction of fission reactors. To form a valid structure, build a cuboid shell of casing, making sure to *exclude* the edges. Then place a fission controller along an edge, at a corner or within one of the faces of the structure. If the GUI shows an error, make sure the structure is valid. Then fill the interior with reactor cells, coolers and moderator blocks to start generating energy from your fission fuels!
Blast Block
A highly blast resistant block which is perfect for protection against explosives.
Transparent Fission Reactor Casing
Used in the construction of fission reactors. To form a valid structure, build a cuboid shell of casing, making sure to *exclude* the edges. Then place a fission controller along an edge, at a corner or within one of the faces of the structure. If the GUI shows an error, make sure the structure is valid.
