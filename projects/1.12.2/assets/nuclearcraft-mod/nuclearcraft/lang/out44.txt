Enable Ore Dict Raw Material Recipes
Will Ore Dictionary inputs be used for 'ingot <-> block' crafting and 'dust -> ingot' furnace recipes? If false, the NC ingredient will be used.
Enable Ore Dict Mod Priority
Will Ore Dictionary outputs be prioritised according to the mod list below? If false, the default Ore Dict entry will be used when deciding machine outputs.
Ore Dict Mod Priority
Determines the priority of each mod's ore dictionary entries - earlier mods' IDs in this list have a higher priority. This is used to determine which mod's corresponding item is produced in machine recipes. If no matching mod is found, the default entry is used.
