Fusion Connector
Connects a fusion core to its ring of electromagnets. Four sets of them are required for each side of the core.
Reactor Cell
Used in fission reactors to house the fission fuels. The more cells placed, the more rapidly fuel is used. %s
Cells will be more efficient for each other cell they are adjacent to, or for each adjacent line of moderator blocks, of length %s at most, ending with another cell.
