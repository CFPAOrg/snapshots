Block Stack Radiation
List of blocks and their radiation levels. Can be used to overwrite default values. Format: 'modid:name:meta_radiationLevel'.
Fluid Stack Radiation
List of fluids and their radiation levels. Can be used to overwrite default values. If the fluid has a corresponding block, then it will also be given a radiation level. Format: 'fluidName_radiationLevel'.
Food Radiation and Resistance
List of foods and the rads and rad resistance gained on consumption. Negative values mean rads and rad resistance will be lost. Can be used to overwrite default values. Format: 'modid:name:meta_radiationLevel_radiationResistance'.
Ore Stack Radiation Blacklist
List of ore dict entries that will be forced not have a radiation level. Format: 'oreName'.
Item Stack Radiation Blacklist
List of items that will be forced not have a radiation level. Format: 'modid:name:meta'.
Block Stack Radiation Blacklist
List of blocks that will be forced not have a radiation level. Format: 'modid:name:meta'.
Fluid Radiation Blacklist
List of fluids that will be forced not have a radiation level. Format: 'fluidName'.
Max Player Rads
The maximum number of rads a player can have before the radiation is fatal.
Player Radiation Decay Rate
The rate at which player radiation decreases over time, as a fraction of the player's current radiation level per tick.
Entity Radiation Decay Rate
The rate at which entity radiation decreases over time, as a fraction of the entity's current radiation level per tick.
Chunk Radiation Spread Rate
Controls the rate at which radiation will spread from chunk to chunk.
Chunk Radiation Spread Gradient
Controls how high the ratio of radiation levels between chunks must be for radiation to spread between them.
Chunk Radiation Decay Rate
Controls the rate at which radiation decreases in a chunk over time.
Lowest Radiation Rate
