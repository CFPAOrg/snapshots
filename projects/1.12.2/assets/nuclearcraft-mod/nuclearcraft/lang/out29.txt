Heat removed per tick/mB. Order: water, redstone, quartz, gold, glowstone, lapis, diamond, liquid helium, ender, cryotheum, iron, emerald, copper, tin, magnesium.
Water Cooler Requirement
Do water coolers have to fulfill their position requirements to be valid?
Enable Meltdowns
Can fission reactors overheat?
Enable Explosions
Will fission reactors explode when they overheat?
Meltdown Radiation Multiplier
Modifies the radiation leaked by meltdowns.
Minimum Structure Length
Minimum side length of fission structures.
Maximum Structure Length
Maximum side length of fission structures.
Max Comparator Signal Heat
Percentage heat level of a fission reactor at which a comparator adjacent to the controller will output a full-strength redstone signal.
Force Heat Comparator
If enabled, the controller of a heat-negative or heat-neutral reactor will output a heat-based comparator signal as if it were heat-positive instead of an energy-based one.
Maximum Active Cooler Fluid Use
Maximum rate at which the Active Fluid Cooler uses coolant in mB/s.
Fission Sound Volume
Modifier for the volume of fission sound effects.
Moderator Power Modifier
*Only effects new mechanics.* Determines the extra power generated by each moderator block adjacent to a reactor cell. Equal to the effective number of extra cell's worth of power that would be generated by a cell totally surrounded by moderator blocks. Each moderator block will contribute one sixth of this amount of power (the amount of additional power scales linearly with the number of moderator blocks).
