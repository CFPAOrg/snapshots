Machine Interface
Automation can access the machine directly adjacent to this block. Can only extend one adjacent machine at maximum.
Buffer
Can store up to a stack of items, 32000 RF of energy and 16000 mB of fluid. Will offload energy and materials into adjacent machines and active coolers. Can be placed in the shell of fission structures for transportation into and out of the reactor.
Active Fluid Cooler
Pump coolant into this block to cool down fission and fusion reactors. Must be placed in a fission structure or on the diagonal of a fusion ring. If used to cool a fission reactor, the requirements for each fluid type are the same as the passive counterpart, but active coolers can not be used to support other coolers' placement rules. If used to cool a fusion reactor, it is much more efficient for a cooler to have a partner on the exact opposite side of the entire fusion ring.
