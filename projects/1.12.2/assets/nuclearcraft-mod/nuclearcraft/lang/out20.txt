Speed Upgrade
Increases the processing speed of machines at the cost of additional processing power. These upgrades can be stacked - the speed will increase %s with each additional upgrade while the power use will increase %s.
Energy Upgrade
Decreases the processing power of machines. These upgrades can be stacked, but the maximum number that will have an effect is equal to the number of installed speed upgrades. The power use will decrease %s with each additional upgrade.
