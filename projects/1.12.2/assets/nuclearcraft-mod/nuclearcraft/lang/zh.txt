Fission Reactor Moderator
Fission Reactor Casing
Used in the construction of fission reactors. To form a valid structure, build a cuboid shell of casing, making sure to *exclude* the edges. Then place a fission controller along an edge, at a corner or within one of the faces of the structure. If the GUI shows an error, make sure the structure is valid. Then fill the interior with reactor cells, coolers and moderator blocks to start generating energy from your fission fuels!

Fusion Core
This is the central part of a multiblock fusion reactor that produces large amounts of energy from the heat generated by a nuclear fusion reaction. The core needs to have a ring of fusion electromagnets around it symmetrically, connected by four sets of fusion connectors on all four sides. The ring, which is actually a square, needs to be hollow and does not require electromagnets to be diagonal to the hollow section - active fluid coolers can be used here instead. Make sure that the far corners are fully squared off, too.

Reduces the radiation level of the chunk it is placed in. Its effectiveness is dependent on the amount of free space around it. Alone, it will remove a maximum of %s of the radiation in its chunk, though the collective contribution from all scrubbers in the chunk will stack non-linearly.

Speed Upgrade
Increases the processing speed of machines at the cost of additional processing power. These upgrades can be stacked - the speed will increase %s with each additional upgrade while the power use will increase %s.
Energy Upgrade
Decreases the processing power of machines. These upgrades can be stacked, but the maximum number that will have an effect is equal to the number of installed speed upgrades. The power use will decrease %s with each additional upgrade.

Radiation Badge Durability
Determines the total radiation that a Radiation Badge can be exposed to before disintegrating.
Radiation Badge Info Rate
Determines the amount of exposed radiation after which the Radiation Badge will inform the player of its total exposure level as a fraction of the durability.
Hardcore Stacks
If enabled, the radioactive stacks in a player's inventory will irradiate the chunk the player is in as well as the player directly.
Hardcore Containers
The radioactive stacks in container blocks will irradiate the chunk the tile entity is in at a rate of this fraction of their base radiation level.
Radiation From Dropped Items
Radioactive items dropped on the ground will irradiate the chunk they are in.
Radiation Death Persistence
If enabled, players' rad levels will persist on death.
Death Persistence Fraction
Specifies the fraction of the player's rad level that persists if Radiation Death Persistence is enabled.
Post-Death Immunity Time
Number of seconds players will have radiation immunity after death due to radiation.
Player Radiation Effects
Lists of potion effects experienced at various percentages of radiation level by players. Format: 'radPercent_potionNameA@strength,potionNameB@strength,...,potionNameZ@strength'.
Passive Entity Radiation Effects
Lists of potion effects experienced at various percentages of radiation level by passive entities. Format: 'radPercent_potionNameA@strength,potionNameB@strength,...,potionNameZ@strength'.
Mob Radiation Effects
Lists of potion effects experienced at various percentages of radiation level by mobs. Format: 'radPercent_potionNameA@strength,potionNameB@strength,...,potionNameZ@strength'.
Horse Armor
If enabled, horses can be equipped with radiation-protective armor.

JEI Chance Output Display
Will the chance item output cycle in JEI include empty stacks if a possible output stack size is 0? If false, a minimum stack size of 1 shall be shown - although some info about the recipe is lost this way, it looks much neater. This will only effect the outputs in JEI and not the actual functioning of the machines.
Generate Wasteland Biome
Will the Wasteland Biome generate in the Overworld?
Wasteland Biome Gen Weight
The weight assigned to the generation of the Wasteland Biomes - higher numbers correspond to higher generation rates.
Enable Wasteland Dimension
Will the Wasteland Dimension be generated?
Wasteland Dimension ID
Set the dimension ID for the Wasteland Dimension.
Mushroom Spread Rate
Glowing Mushroom spread rate.
Generate Mushrooms
Will glowing mushrooms generate in the nether?
Mushroom Gen Size
Determines how many glowing mushrooms will spawn at a time.
Mushroom Gen Rate
Determines how often glowing mushrooms will spawn.
Enable Rare Drops
Will mobs drop rare items?
Enable Dungeon Loot
Will NuclearCraft loot generate in chests?
Register Fission Fluid Blocks
Register fission fluid and molten salt coolant blocks? Keep false if running low on block IDs.
Register CoFH Fluid Alternatives
Register alternative Thermal Foundation fluids? It is recommended that this is set to true if no CoFH mods are installed.
Register Base EMC Values
Register NC raw material EMC values if ProjectE is installed?
Enable Ore Dict Raw Material Recipes
Will Ore Dictionary inputs be used for 'ingot <-> block' crafting and 'dust -> ingot' furnace recipes? If false, the NC ingredient will be used.
Enable Ore Dict Mod Priority
Will Ore Dictionary outputs be prioritised according to the mod list below? If false, the default Ore Dict entry will be used when deciding machine outputs.
Ore Dict Mod Priority
Determines the priority of each mod's ore dictionary entries - earlier mods' IDs in this list have a higher priority. This is used to determine which mod's corresponding item is produced in machine recipes. If no matching mod is found, the default entry is used.
