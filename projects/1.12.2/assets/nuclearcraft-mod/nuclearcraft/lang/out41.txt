Radiation Default Armor Shielding
List of armor item stacks and their default radiation shielding levels. Format: 'modid:armorName:meta_resistance'. Note: this is not the only way to add these values if you have CraftTweaker installed. Rad resistance can also be given to armor by changing their recipe such that an NBT tag called "ncRadiationResistance" with the double value equal to the resistance level is attached to it.
Radiation HUD Size
Modifier for the size of radiation info on the HUD.
Radiation HUD Position
Angle from the centre of the screen at which radiation info appears on the HUD. 0 degrees is the top of the screen, 45 is top-right, etc.
HUD Cartesian Position
Optional config to specify where the rads overlay should appear on the screen if not wanted on a side or at a corner - if used, this config will be used in place of the angle-based one. Two doubles are required [x, y] which specify how far right (x) and how far down (y) from the top-left corner of the screen the overlay is drawn at.
HUD Text Outline
If enabled, a black outline will surround the radiation counter text underneath the rad bar.
Counter Required For Info
If disabled, the rads overlay will show and the ticking will be heard even when a Geiger Counter is not being held.
Counter/Scrubber Chunk Boundaries
If enabled, chunk boundaries will be shown while holding or looking at a geiger counter block or radiation scrubber.
Radiation Unit Prefixes
If set to a positive integer, radiation levels will be shown without unit prefixes to this number of significant figures.
Radiation Badge Durability
Determines the total radiation that a Radiation Badge can be exposed to before disintegrating.
Radiation Badge Info Rate
Determines the amount of exposed radiation after which the Radiation Badge will inform the player of its total exposure level as a fraction of the durability.
