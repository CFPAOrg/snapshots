Biomancy
Metal Transmutation
I've grown tired of constantly going deeper into the mines to gather the resources that I need. After heavily researching different metals, I realized that even though they have different properties, fundamentally they are the same. I need to investigate further.
I DID IT! Iron is the most simple among all metals, so it can serve as a "blank slate" for all other metals. Going from there, I only need to add other aspects to it for it to transform. Also, I can only use nuggets for the process: otherwise I can't get the essentia to penetrate the metal correctly. <BR/>Even though it's only iron that can be transmuted, it still goes a long way towards fulfilling my needs.
Biomancy
The biothaumic mind was a major success at harnessing organic substances to create new devices. Ever since then, I was toying with the idea of applying more magic to organic matter. <LINE> I prepared some materials form some very basic experiments. Based on my current theories and experience, it should not be too hard.
There's a difference between theory, and reality. The magic that I'm trying to apply causes a heavy amount of scarring in booth plants and animals, something that I did not experienced while making the biothaumic mind.  I prepared for a second experiment, now attempting to use some victus, to mitigate the effects of the magic.
I think I might be onto something. Reducing the strength of the spell, or reducing the amount of essentia touching the tissue allows me to finish the procedure whitout major damage. I tweaked my thaumatorium accordingly.<PAGE> Simply studying the living or the dead that I slay should also give me more insight into the ways of life. (Creatures killed by hand drop knowledge)
Plant growth
I believe that the aspects creating the elements that plants need to grow should be able to create a reaction that grows the plant instantaneously... or explode on the spot.
