I created the substance. Now I want to try out if I could increase the strenght of the creature.
Success. The new enchantment is indeed potent, but it will not work alone I'll need some internal reinforcements, or else the limbs will fall off. <LINE> Now that I see some of the applications and limitations of this technique, I want to see if I can create an enchant, that would transcend the abilities of one creature, and make it behave like it's something else. <BR><BR>A spider should suffice.
Was a little harder than expected, but the property transfer was successfull. <LINE> Before moving forward, I want to see if speed has the same limitations as strength.
Interestingly, it does not. Still needs some getting used to.<LINE> Lastly, I want to see, if increased vitality would be the answer to the fragility problem of strength.
That's it for now. I need to learn more before I can do more.
The vitality enchantment will increase the creature's regenerative abilities.
The strength enchantment will increase the power output of the creature's muscles.
The spider limbs enchantment, infuses the creature with the essence of a spider, allowing it to climb up walls, and stick to them.
The speed enchantment increases the movement speed of the creature.<LINE> Because they target similar musche groups, the strenght enchant will cause it to increase the fall damage that the creature takes. <LINE> Because of the hardening effects of the protection enchant that is affecting movement to a degree, it will cause the creature to need more enegry to function,
The fertility enchantment allows enchanted animals to give birth to additional offspring. Each enchanted parent provides one extra baby. <LINE> Creatures with higher intellect are somewhat unaffected.
The protection enchantment is very straightforward: every level will divide the damage that the enchanted creature will take.
