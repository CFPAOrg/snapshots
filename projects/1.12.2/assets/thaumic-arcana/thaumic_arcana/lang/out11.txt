Slime reanimation
Now that I've established exactly how slimes are, I should be able to "reanimate", or really just reform a slime into it's cubic form. Knowing that simply making a large enough clump of slime is not enough, I've prepared a few items for the experiment.
The "reanimation" formula worked wonderously. I can create a lump of slimes that can "reanimate" itself. Even tough I have no control over the size, I might find a use for it.
Slime meat
Slime is able to fuse with inanimate matter, and take up some of it's properties. Question is, what would happen if I fused it with meat?
The slime took up the structure, texture and some of the smell of the meat. Slime is actually quite nutritious it seems, but I would not put it into my mouth raw.
Slime infusion
Attempting to make slime fuse with raw magic could answer why it appears only in two variants.
The results are telling. I need to treat it with fabrico, it makes it more mallable and reactive. It is also less sticky than it was, possibly the reason why I could not put int back into a viable slime.Than I can use vis and a shard to infuse it with the appropriate aspect.<BR> Altough, it comes with it's own benefits. <LINE>I can brew it into an awkward potion to get some effects, and I can also brew up to 5 slimes into one potion. Altough the concussion is really unstable and will be ruined if I take it under traditional brewing methods. <LINE> I can also put it down on floors, and it will apply it's effect when someone or something steps on it.<LINE> NOT ALL ASPECTS HAVE AN EFFECT! <LINE> First, I need to create a slime infused with fabrico through alchemy before i can fuse it with any other aspect.
Infused Slime Tools
Can tools made out of slime be treated the same way as normal slime? The way I fuse it with metal is not as drastic as the infusion with essentia.
