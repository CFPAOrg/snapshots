Mind Inhibitor
 This fragmented soul can not live. But what would happen if I were to inject it into something that has a living soul?
 I can't place it. It surpresses the behaviour of the creature, altough I can not use it on any sentient creature. I wonder what can I do with this?
Experience Storage
 Souls are connected to minds. (in theory) I wonder if I could use a soul to connect two minds together.
 It sorta works. I can create a one way link that transfers knowledge between the brains. Based on this I created a device that can transfer my experiences into a jarred brain, for safe keeping. Altough, because of the decreased cognitive capacities of a zombie brain, some of the experience is lost.
