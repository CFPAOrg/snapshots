 The dyes reacted well to my treatment.
Creature Enchant Modification
While studying the phenomenons around creature enchants, there was something that was bothering me. It is not only affecting the flesh, but also the aura around the subject. This new "field", created by the magical dusts binds the magic to the creature. I alsp noticed that this field is connected to the local aura, in a way that I don't fully understand. <BR><BR>To crack this mystery, first I'm going to try to alter it's behaviour. I should be able to alter it, so that it changes the way the enchants bind. <LINE> But, first things first, I should have a way to stabilise this field, just in case something goes wrong. My theory is that a strong enough binding agent, should be able to carry the spell.
Now that I have some sort of safety net to work with, I want to see how easy it would be to break this bond down. My intiial design was that it should be as strong as possible, so that the subject can not reject it.
Total failure. I still can not break the bond, and the only thing I have, is a spell that currupts the magical energies of the enchantments. They will either stop working, or turn to their opposite effects.
The negation modifier will flip the multiplier of the enchantment.
The normal modifier will revert the binding to it's default state.
Plant experiments
Now that I understand how I can use magic on plants, I want to see if I could make a mundane plant display magical properties. Maybe make some silverwood?
No! No! No! <BR> The plant is now currupted, and is completly tainted. It looks like plants don't take it well when you try to change them fundamentally, or my method is wrong.Took a bit to get rid of this thing and fix the damage it caused.<LINE> Next I will try to make a small alteration. Nothing big, maybe change only the trunk. Let's try again like that.
