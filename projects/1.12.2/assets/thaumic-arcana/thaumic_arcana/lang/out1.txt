The first steps are promising: using alchemical principles, I was able to trigger rapid growth in seeds. Unfortunately, the resulting plant did not yield anything to repeat the process. I must try it on other plants.
Other plants are reacting much better than wheat, resulting in a net gain. The methodology is still not perfect, but the results look edible.
I have to see what happens when I use different breeds of plants. Maybe that can give me answers.
Now I can alchemically grow my food on demand. The infertility problem of some plants proves to be harder to get rid of than I anticipated.
Bestialchemy
I want to try something out, with my tweaks to my alchemy. The first experiment I prepared is an egg. With the correct formula, I should be able to trigger the growth of the embrio, and create an egg that will always hatch.
Now that I observed how essentia effects the growth of an animal, I can apply it in a different fashion. Theoretically, I can use Victus to trigger the growth of meat outside the animal. I'm going to add some Beastia as well, just in case the tissue needs a more familiar environment.
The experiment was a complete success. Now I am able to farm meat without growing the whole animal, and interestingly enough, I only need Victus to do so. I'll take note on that.
Alchemical Fertilization
Now that I know how adding essentia to plants affect them, I can try to create a different application. I'm going to create a more potent fertilizer. I was thinking about bone meal, but it might fizzle if I add too much essentia. Instead of that, I'm going to take my experience from the time I made a focus.<BR/>I'm going to try to use an Herba crystal to absorb the aspects required to trigger growth. It should also help to make sure that my substance is actually compatible with plants.
This experiment was a resounding success. I created a new fertilizer that I can acquire more easily than traditional substances(bone meal, bone meal, and... oh, just bone meal).
