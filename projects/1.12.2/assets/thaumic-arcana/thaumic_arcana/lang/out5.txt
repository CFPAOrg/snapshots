I created a recipe for a special kind of mixture that is able to speed up the growth of any animal.
Leather Processing
Now that I can make flesh, I want to figure how to make leather. In theory, I should be able to make the meat grow the hide on itself.
I failed to grow the hide, but found something else. I can make the flesh harden into a leather like substance, and the process is similar to what I used on rotten flesh.
Bush Alchemy
When I was growing plants, it wasn't too hard to add too much essentia, which sometimes causes its growth to go out of control. This was able to mutilate the plant. <LINE> This can be useful. If I don't care about the deformities than some new applications could emerge, namely to grow trees this way.
The tree is more of a bush, but it is able to give me wood. I also need to add some vacuos to the formula, so I can improve the spatial conditions in there for long enough to make it so that it won't get stuck in my cauldron, or thaumatorium. <LINE>The leaves overgrew, and became so hard that I need to crack it open by smashing it to a wall.
The process causes a yield lower than expected. I don't think I should do this to plants where this problem didn't occur.
Biomanuafactury
 Now that I figured how to force plants to grow, I want to do something different. I want to see if I can fabricate products that would normally come from different plants in more flexible ways. <LINE> The first thing I want to try is to solve a problem that has been emerging during my work. I use a lot of paper while doing research and studies. <BR> I prepared a few candidates and samples that should be usable to create paper.
 I ended up choosing wood as the material for this. With the correct essentia, I can soften and reshape it's fibers to turn it into fine sheets of paper. <LINE> Now I want to do something different. I want to see if I could mold or even grow other resources. <BR> Making more of some dead plantmatter should do it.
