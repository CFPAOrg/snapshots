Now it works. The sapling is viable,but I'm not sure if it can reproduce. It still might be tainted, which gives me the idea on what if I treated it with only taint? And some victus just to make sure that it survives.
Now I think I understand how to make small modifications to a plant. First, I need to pick the basic aspects that are required for the plant to grow,and add it to the sapling. Than I need to soak it in the essence that I can use to slightly modify it. Only stir it gently, since we want to avoid scarring! Than I can get a sapling that is viable, can grow but is unable to reproduce properly. It will always reproduce as if it was a normal oak tree.
Creature Enchant Modifier: Negation
To keep myself better organised, I'll note the known effects of negation here. If it's not listed, it will only be disabled.<BR>Only time will tell the horrors I'm about to find...
The Fertile enchant gives a chance to reduce birthrates.
The Strength enchant will give weakness instead of strength.
The Speed enchant will give slowness instead of speed.
The Vitality enchant will wither instead of regenerating.
The Protection enchant will increase the damage instead of reducing it.
The healt boost enchant will reduce the creature's total health.
The agility enchant will prevent the creature from jumping.
The haste enchant will slow down the mining speed of the enchanted creature.
Enchantment Focusing
If I understand the relations between creature enchants and the aura, than I should be able to create a foci, that can flip the enchants off. A least if ym theory is correct.
Yes. Just as I tought. <BR>The binder actually embeds the creature into the local aura, than turns some of it's life energies into vis. One last thing. Can I apply something similar to my understanding of paving stones, so I don't need to use a focus to get the effects?
