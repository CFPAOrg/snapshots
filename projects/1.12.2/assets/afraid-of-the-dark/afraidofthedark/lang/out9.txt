Enaria
This doesn't sound too hard!
Enaria is in the lowest level of the Gnomish city. If I can rid the world of her wretched form, perhaps I can also become magically adept myself.
Now that I have defeated Enaria, secrets have unveiled themselves about a new power. I have always adored reading about the ancient mages of the past able to detonate mountains with a simple blink. After Enaria's fall, I felt beset by a compelling influential presence. I wonder what it may unveil to me.
Enaria's Secret
spells at last
Ever since Enaria's demise I have been sleepless. Whispers taunt me in the night. I recall seeing Enaria's phantom quietly dancing in my nightmares, and now this similar slight murmur beckons me to return.
New Research!
Insanity's Heights
Foul Ole Ron
To whomever finds this: don't stay here. This place is evil. I have been stuck here for longer than I can remember. I can hear the abyss calling to me. It beckons me to jump, calling my name. I've found all of the notes, but I cannot;;leave with them. There are ten scrolls hidden here. Three are in the tallest tower, with two being near the top and one being near the bottom. The saw mill whispers such sweet things to be. The stone tower says that it has two;;gifts for me. What pretty things they have, so many rings. Enaria's bones whisper to me from her grave. I'm sorry; we tried to save you! Her whispers make me want to hide inside of the log. The roof top rooms are hiding something;;from me. They always stay quiet when I am near. I know they are keeping secrets from me! What has it told you? What has the monolith told you to make you stop talking to me? Answer me Enaria! Where have you gone? Have you left me?;;You said we would be together forever!
