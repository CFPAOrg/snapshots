To obtain Sawdust, you need to harvest logs using a saw. There's a 50% chance to drop and also another 50% chance the log is consumed in the process.
Used to get latex, right click a hevea tree log with a hammer in your toolbar to place. Complete the latex tapping by placing a bowl mount, an empty bowl and right clicking with a knife to open a vein of flowing latex.
To get latex, you need a rubber tapper. Right click a Wrought Iron Groove (with a hammer on toolbar) on any hevea tree log, then place a bowl mount, an empty bowl and open a vein of fluid latex by right clicking with a knife.
Consumes energy to cool down your foods effectively slowing down decay. Efficiency rises when the door is kept closed and has sufficient energy.
Used to draw out wires. Right click to pull metal wires through the draw plate. Draw plate needs to be at least the same tier of the wire.

Heat metal items using the power of electricity!
Right click an empty mold into any container holding molten glass.
