Bloody Enchantress
The Bloody Enchantress creates &4Mana&0 by consuming nearby creatures' life. Creatures sacrificed to the Bloody Enchantress will not produce any drops or experience.
Every bite will add a effect called Blood Temptation and overlay with higher amplifier one, the mana production will decrease according to the level of Blood Temptation, and the flower will stop working if the total level of Blood Temptation of all the creatures nearby is over a threshold.
The only cure is death.
Burning soul
Sunshine Lily
Like the &1Dayblooms&0 the Sunshine Lily produces &4Mana&0 from sunlight, but it is slightly more efficient. Please note that it will still decay.

Mana from the sun
Moonlight Lily
Like the &1Nightshade&0 the Moonlight Lily generates &4Mana&0 at night, but it is slightly more efficient. Please note that it will still decay.

Mana from the moon
Omniviolet
According to a saying, knowledge is power. The Omniviolet converts Books or Written Books into &4Mana&0. To increase the amount of mana generated, Bookshelves can be placed around the Omniviolet in a similar fashion to an Enchantment Table.
