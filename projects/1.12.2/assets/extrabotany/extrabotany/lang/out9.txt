By passing &4Forge Energy&0 through a field of natural energy, its state can be transformed from redstone based energy into &4Mana&0.<br>Simply attaching &4FE&0 transporters, will start the conversion from &4FE&0 to &4Mana&0. A Mana Spreader is needed to transfer the &4Mana&0.

Special-made Cocktail
By crafting any flask/vial potion with a Mana Cocktail , you can make a Special-made Cocktail that can be drinked two more times than the original flask/vial and it has a longer effect. <br>Aditionaly very special potions have been added and can be crafted into Cocktails too.
Greatly improve the efficiency of mining, but overdraft your luck
High level of resistance, but slow as turtle.
Gain super strength, but what's the cost?
Almost all positive effects! But wouldn't last long
One can make you floating, may be better if used on enemies?
Infinite Wine
Infinite Wine, that you can drink almost infinitly, it only costs mana to refill. To make one, you just need to combine a Special-made Cocktail with heroes medal.You can change the effects by crafting with other varieties of Special-made Cocktail. <br>Be carefull though, if you drink it all before it can refill, you will lose your relic and get a empty mana glass back, and you can only Restore 3 uses per minecraft day.
