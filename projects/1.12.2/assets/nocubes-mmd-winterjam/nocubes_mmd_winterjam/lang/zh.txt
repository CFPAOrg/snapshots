Rendering Algorithm
What algorithm renders your world\nOld NoCubes - The very fast original renderer from NoCubes 0.3 by Click_ME\nMarching Cubes - The original smoothing algorithm that has existed since 1986 - Fast, Well documented\nSurface Nets - A smoothing algorithm - Slightly slower, Dual contouring!\n\nInteractive examples: https://wordsandbuttons.online/interactive_explanation_of_marching_cubes_and_dual_contouring.html
Reload Chunks when Config changes
If chunks should be reloaded when settings change
Fix Face Culling (Not Implemented!)
If Face Culling issues (like the bottom of trees not rendering correctly) should be fixed
Smooth Liquids (Not Implemented!)
If liquids (lava and water) should be rendered extended into smoothable blocks
Draw Wireframe (Not Implemented!)
If a wireframe should be drawn on non-air blocks
Smoothable BlockStates
Block States that the Rendering Algorithm will smooth
BetterFoliage Grass Compatibility
If BetterFoliage's grass should be allowed to render under specific circumstances (requires BetterFoliage)
Isosurface Level
The expansion of the generated surface mesh (hard to explain, just play around with it)\nBest values:\nOld NoCubes: N/A\nMarching Cubes: 0.001 or 0.5\nSurface Nets: 1.0
Hide Outside Blocks
Hide blocks that are outside the isosurface (leads to invisible blocks, great for screenshots - bad for survival gameplay)
