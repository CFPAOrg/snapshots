Getting Started
How to get into guns
Welcome, fellow future &mAmericans&r gunslingers!<br>Are you bored of lame old boring guns? Because, we Wizards over at Team Wizardry sure where! We've devised a wide array of new toys for our magic loving audience who believe bullets are faster than wand waving.
Ok, that's the stuff I was required to say out of the way. They're making me write this at 9PM on a Friday night, so don't expect much.<br>We've got lots of guns. Pistols for those of you who want to shoot things. Shotguns for those who want to shoot things &oharder&r. Sniper Rifles... you guessed it. Then we've got miniguns, where you can shoot things a &olot&r. Turrets, if you're too lazy to shoot things yourself. Luckily, someone from another department is in charge of writing that documentation. It'll be elsewhere in this book.<br>We've developed lots of types of bullets and grenades for you to try out... some of them rather nonsensical. Just lace a gunpowder bullet with the correct stuff to make it work. I'll put the recipes in the entries when I get around to writing them.<br>We don't have safeties on our weapons. One of these days, I will find HR and strangle their managers. Until then, just keep your guns out of the way until you need them. You can load them by taking ammo in your other hand and shoving it into an empty gun. If you need to make a drum or a magazine, just put some bullets together in a crafting table and they'll fall into a container.
And, of course, Wizardry Offices is not responsible for any damage or loss of life incurred from use of our technology.
Pistol
Range: Short/Medium | Ammo: Magazine
The Pistol is a type of hand gun that's best used when you want to fire at a fair fire-rate but don't want to hold a ton of bullets on your person.<br>This gun can be reloaded with a Magazine loaded with small bullets.<br>Magazines can hold a maximum of 8 small bullets.
The Pistol is best used against short to medium range targets. After that, it's small bullets drop hard in power.<br>This gun deals a decent amount of damage, but nothing crazy; especially because it doesn't aim perfectly.
Shotgun
Range: Short | Ammo: Shells
The Shotgun is a gun that can unload 5 bullets per shotgun shell. The bullets shoot out in a fairly scattered manner and are generally weak, but if multiple of those bullets hit the same target, it can deal lethal amounts of damage.
The Shotgun bullets are very strictly short-range, they die off fast otherwise. You can only load 1 Shotgun Shell at a time in the shotgun.
Sniper Rifle
Range: Medium/Long | Ammo: Cartridge
The Sniper Rifle is one of the most powerful guns we've been able to enhance with magic bullets. This gun can fire with perfect accuracy and with extreme power.
This gun uses heavy bullets to only and can only load one at a time. Due to the bulkiness and power required for this gun, it takes a long time to cool down and reload.<br>The Sniper Rifle is best used against long range targets.
Minigun
Range: Short | Ammo: Drum
The Minigun, often nicknamed "gatling gun" is an interesting weapon. It has a very very high fire rate and consumes Bullet Drums of small bullets. A single Bullet Drum can hold up to a hundred bullets at a time.
This gun is best used against short to medium range targets as - despite it's high fire rate - has a very large scatter in it's bullets and each bullet tends to be very weak. When multiple bullets hit the same target, it can deal lethal damage.
Grenade
Range: Short/Medium/Long
Grenades are hand-held throwable explosives that can be loaded with effects. Unfortunately, the effects grenades can be loaded with are not compatible with those of the bullet effects we managed to create. As a result, we've created 5 very powerful effects for grenades only so we didn't leave you with something boring.
You can read more about grenade specific effects in the Effects category.
Turret
Range: Short/Medium | Ammo: Magazine
Despite our amazing creations to keep our boredom at bay, we got bored anyways with shooting the guns ourselves and having to deal with actually aiming them. So we've created a magic Turret machine that will do the job for us.
And despite the turrets' magical aiming properties, we couldn't invent one that fuels itself from the air around it, so until we manage to make that, you'll want to fuel your turrets with burnable fuel sources.
You can insert coal into it from the sides of the machine with a hopper to fuel it, then you can insert your magical bullets from the top of the turret to load it up. For security reasons we had to deal with the hard way, the turret requires redstone power to operate.
Only the placer of the turret will not be attacked by the turret. Otherwise, if you are closer than 4 blocks from the turret, it wont try to murder you.
Balefire
Reality-destroying fire in bullet form
Balefire rounds have a tendency to "unexist" things they hit. Blocks and monsters die or vanish in its path, and it leaves a trail of fire.<br><br>A lady with a strangely ageless face gave us a huge pile of books on how to use it, but none of our scholars could get past the first one.
Biotic
Shoot to heal
These bullets... heal people when they get shot. We're not sure how. This doesn't make any sense, does it?<br><br>We have it on good authority from an old lady and an angel that Biotic tech makes sense and has a perfect scientific explanation. However, their Swedish friend keeps ranting about how "the science doesn't check out." Well, Swedish man, we don't care, so long as it works. Healing bullets! Woo.
Draconic
Boom
These bullets are really reactive. They explode. Hard.<br><br>Making them is a really bad idea. Well, unless you like fun.
Firework
Fancy colors
One of our interns had some leftovers from the Fourth of July, so we strapped them to bullets. They make fancy splashes of color!
Flash
Just the way to kill your eyes
Do you not like your enemies seeing things? Well, these bullets can solve that. They're so bright that even looking at their explosion can blind you.<br><br>You should probably look away when you fire them. We didn't think this through.
Frost
How to get people to chill out
These rounds freeze people when they hit, leaving them slippery, slow, and smelling vaguely of mint.
Graviton
Pull things in
These bullets are whatever the exact opposite of an explosive is. They pull you in, instead of pushing you away.<br><br>Our interns say they arrived in a package from Russia unannounced, so handle at your own risk.
Repulsion
Push things out
We heard you liked explosives, so we put explosives in your explosives. We didn't put enough in to break anything, but they'll blast away anything unlucky enough to be near where they hit.
Hookshot
Pull yourself
Some guy in cosplay ran into our office, yelled a lot, and then tied a rope to a bullet. We're not sure why. But hey, free bullet design! It pulls you towards it when it lands.<br><br>We sent a few guys to climb a mountain to test them out. Only one returned, but he found a sweet golden triangle!
Impact
Hit things hard
We made our bullets bigger. Now, instead of just killing your enemies, you can kill dirt and stone, too.<br><br>... Who designed these, again? A dwarf? Yeah, that sounds about right.
Piercing
Bullets but, like, arrows
We replaced the heads of our bullets with arrows. Not sure how they don't shatter to pieces, but hey, whatever lets us punch through hordes of zombies.
Psyker
Homing
We contracted a bunch of really armored dudes to make us awesome bullets. They gave us these, told us they're holy. Whatever. They home in on enemies, apparently.
Tainted
Poisonous
Fred spilled his lunch all over one batch of bullets. It turns out that Fred's lunch is the deadliest substance known to mankind. We now use it as a poisoning agent, tipping these bullets in "Fred-toxin."
Tranquilizer
Liquid sleep
We bottled up the brain chemical your body produces when you're in a lecture, and shoved it into cases. Unsurprisingly, it turns out to make humans and monsters alike go to sleep.
Blizzard
Portable winter
Freezing cold, snow, and pain, all in convenient bomb form! Who could ask for more!<br>A lot of people, now that I think about it. What happened to all our QA guys?
Daylight
Portable luminance
Some trolls told us that daylight is dangerous. We thought, why not?<br>Well, it wasn't, until our Engineering team got a hold of it. With some extra explosives, and a pinch of magic, we made a bomb that explodes with light.<br>Don't look at it when it goes off. Or be near it. Give them to your greatest enemy as a decoration.
Disco
Your annoying coworker in grenade form
R and D managed to liquify Bill. Good riddance.<br>But we had to do something with all that seventies-old-dude juice. He makes a pretty good dance bomb.<br><br>Wait, we're using a person in our bombs? How did HR ever agree to this?
Repulsion
Get away... or have it do it for you
We needed a way to clean up the cafeteria after lunch. I threw a bunch of gunpowder in a bomb, added some pillows, and voila: a bomb that blows stuff away without damaging it.<br><br>I'm still banned from the cafeteria until I can pay to replace all the tables.
