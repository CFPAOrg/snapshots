Blizzard
Portable winter
Freezing cold, snow, and pain, all in convenient bomb form! Who could ask for more!<br>A lot of people, now that I think about it. What happened to all our QA guys?
Daylight
Portable luminance
Some trolls told us that daylight is dangerous. We thought, why not?<br>Well, it wasn't, until our Engineering team got a hold of it. With some extra explosives, and a pinch of magic, we made a bomb that explodes with light.<br>Don't look at it when it goes off. Or be near it. Give them to your greatest enemy as a decoration.
Disco
Your annoying coworker in grenade form
R and D managed to liquify Bill. Good riddance.<br>But we had to do something with all that seventies-old-dude juice. He makes a pretty good dance bomb.<br><br>Wait, we're using a person in our bombs? How did HR ever agree to this?
Repulsion
Get away... or have it do it for you
We needed a way to clean up the cafeteria after lunch. I threw a bunch of gunpowder in a bomb, added some pillows, and voila: a bomb that blows stuff away without damaging it.<br><br>I'm still banned from the cafeteria until I can pay to replace all the tables.
