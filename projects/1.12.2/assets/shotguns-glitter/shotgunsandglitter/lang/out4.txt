Frost
How to get people to chill out
These rounds freeze people when they hit, leaving them slippery, slow, and smelling vaguely of mint.
Graviton
Pull things in
These bullets are whatever the exact opposite of an explosive is. They pull you in, instead of pushing you away.<br><br>Our interns say they arrived in a package from Russia unannounced, so handle at your own risk.
Repulsion
Push things out
We heard you liked explosives, so we put explosives in your explosives. We didn't put enough in to break anything, but they'll blast away anything unlucky enough to be near where they hit.
Hookshot
Pull yourself
Some guy in cosplay ran into our office, yelled a lot, and then tied a rope to a bullet. We're not sure why. But hey, free bullet design! It pulls you towards it when it lands.<br><br>We sent a few guys to climb a mountain to test them out. Only one returned, but he found a sweet golden triangle!
Impact
Hit things hard
We made our bullets bigger. Now, instead of just killing your enemies, you can kill dirt and stone, too.<br><br>... Who designed these, again? A dwarf? Yeah, that sounds about right.
Piercing
Bullets but, like, arrows
We replaced the heads of our bullets with arrows. Not sure how they don't shatter to pieces, but hey, whatever lets us punch through hordes of zombies.
Psyker
Homing
We contracted a bunch of really armored dudes to make us awesome bullets. They gave us these, told us they're holy. Whatever. They home in on enemies, apparently.
Tainted
Poisonous
Fred spilled his lunch all over one batch of bullets. It turns out that Fred's lunch is the deadliest substance known to mankind. We now use it as a poisoning agent, tipping these bullets in "Fred-toxin."
Tranquilizer
Liquid sleep
We bottled up the brain chemical your body produces when you're in a lecture, and shoved it into cases. Unsurprisingly, it turns out to make humans and monsters alike go to sleep.
