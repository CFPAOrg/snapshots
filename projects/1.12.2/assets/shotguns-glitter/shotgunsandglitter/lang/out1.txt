Ok, that's the stuff I was required to say out of the way. They're making me write this at 9PM on a Friday night, so don't expect much.<br>We've got lots of guns. Pistols for those of you who want to shoot things. Shotguns for those who want to shoot things &oharder&r. Sniper Rifles... you guessed it. Then we've got miniguns, where you can shoot things a &olot&r. Turrets, if you're too lazy to shoot things yourself. Luckily, someone from another department is in charge of writing that documentation. It'll be elsewhere in this book.<br>We've developed lots of types of bullets and grenades for you to try out... some of them rather nonsensical. Just lace a gunpowder bullet with the correct stuff to make it work. I'll put the recipes in the entries when I get around to writing them.<br>We don't have safeties on our weapons. One of these days, I will find HR and strangle their managers. Until then, just keep your guns out of the way until you need them. You can load them by taking ammo in your other hand and shoving it into an empty gun. If you need to make a drum or a magazine, just put some bullets together in a crafting table and they'll fall into a container.
And, of course, Wizardry Offices is not responsible for any damage or loss of life incurred from use of our technology.
Pistol
Range: Short/Medium | Ammo: Magazine
The Pistol is a type of hand gun that's best used when you want to fire at a fair fire-rate but don't want to hold a ton of bullets on your person.<br>This gun can be reloaded with a Magazine loaded with small bullets.<br>Magazines can hold a maximum of 8 small bullets.
The Pistol is best used against short to medium range targets. After that, it's small bullets drop hard in power.<br>This gun deals a decent amount of damage, but nothing crazy; especially because it doesn't aim perfectly.
Shotgun
Range: Short | Ammo: Shells
