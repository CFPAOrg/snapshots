My dad was blown away in one of the recent wind storms.
If only I was faster than the wind! That would be fun!
Actually, nevermind. I would be burned on a pyre for being a witch due to our primal society.
Some people say the oceans of blood are actually kool-aid. I'm too scared to taste it for myself.
You don't want to know what it's like to be outside when it rains. You can't tell who's a murderer or who forgot an umbrella!
If you're looking for a good land to swim in, it's definitely not this one.
OH GOD IS THAT BLOOD oh wait nevermind.
Some people say at night, skeletons riding skeleton horses come through the town.
Every once in a blue moon, lightning strikes and burns down the village. We have to rebuild it!
Those darn doomsayers, preaching about the Apocalypse and The Reckoning and such!
What's The Reckoning? It's when meteors from The Veil are sent towards Skaia.
Like any reasonable %s believes in that!
