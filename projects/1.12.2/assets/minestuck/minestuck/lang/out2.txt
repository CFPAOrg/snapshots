You don't want to be struck by lightning. No one does.
We're lucky to have rain with this weather.
Otherwise the thunder would surely have been our death.
This land is HARDCORE! There's lava and lightning wherever you go!
Nemesis has been throwing thunder for generations, not stopping for even a moment.
They are even doing it in their sleep. Can you believe that?
Our daughter wants a bunny for her birthday, even though she caught six in the past three hours.
One time our village ran out of food and we tried eating rabbits. It was a dark period in our village history.
This place is just so full of life! I despise it.
This land is already pretty desolate. There being lots of rabbits eating everything they find doesn't help!
But with that many rabbits around, there sure are other ways of getting food...
I sure wonder where the rabbits are getting their food from.
There's not really much food to be found in this desolate place.
Except maybe cacti, but would rabbits eat something that prickly?
I mean, there's not really much else than mushrooms around here.
I've heard moaning coming from our son's bedroom. I found out he's keeping a pet zombie in there! Tamed it n' everything!
A few giant spiders raided our village last night, taking all of our bugs! Those monsters...
What's your monster-sona? Mine is a zombie.
Legends say underneath the tower to the north is a Captain Lizardtail's buried treasure! Literal tons of bugs, they say!
That tower over there was built by my great grandpa Fjorgenheimer! You can tell by how its about to fall apa- oh it fell apart.
I feel ripped off. I was born in a land full of magical towers but none of them have treasure!
Our smartest villager read all the books in the library and now knows how to make glass jars! He's a gift from the big frog above!
We ate all the books in the nearby college ruins. It turns out thousand-year-old leather doesn't make the best dinner.
