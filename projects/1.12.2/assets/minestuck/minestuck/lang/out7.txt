You do, however, see purple, which is between magenta and blue. Short answer for why that is, your eyes are lying to you.
Beyond the six main colors, however, there are also six other colors: pink, brown, orange, lime, light blue, and purple.
In addition, there are also the tones of white, light gray, gray, and black.
In the additive system, mixing all the colors together makes white.
In the subtractive system, mixing all the colors together makes black.
When dealing with dye, however, you can find some unusual combinations, or lack of combinations.
Dyes work largely on the subtractive color system, but they don't always mix the way they should.
This is because dyes, while vibrant, are imperfect representations of their respective colors.
Lime, for example, should be a mix of yellow and green. To get lime dye, though, you need to mix cactus green with white dye instead.
When mixing red and blue to get magenta, the blue overpowers the red and you get purple. You have to mix the purple with not just red, but pink to get magenta.
Dye is weird like that.
...what, you're still listening to me? Wow. No one's ever listened to the whole thing before. Would you like to hear it again?
This may be the start of our conversation, but now we're at the end.
Never eat fruit. Last time I tried it, I blacked out and came to somewhere else! Stick to bugs like a normal person!
The grass in this place just keeps growing everywhere! I don't even know how it takes root in the stone like that.
Rumors say that %s got mad one day and cursed the world with all this grass everywhere. It gets into our homes!
I once found this piece of junk that launched me upward when I hit the ground with it. It really hurt when I came back down, and I didn't get anywhere!
One time, I saw a guy with some weird wing-looking things on his back. He could glide with them, but without being able to stay in the air, what's the point?
