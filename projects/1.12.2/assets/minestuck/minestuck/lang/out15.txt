Like wheat, but slightly more appetizing. Completely uninteresting to look at!
Wings
You can probably fly with these. They're too big for me, so I don't know.
Black Stone
Why would you want black stone? Because it's marked 50-percent off, of course!
Tear Gas
This foul-smelling gas is sure to make any imp bawl like a newborn.
Plain-Looking Lopsided Ball
Serves no actual function, but this rarity looks completely plain! Surely, this is the height of fine d√©cor.
A plain canvas, untainted by any inks or dyes!
A moldable substance with a plain, muted look, free of artificial colors!
Blue Cake?
It's blue, so I'm pretty sure that it's the fabled Blue Cake. It is said to get you moving!
Cold Cake?
Be careful with that one. It could be a Cold Cake. One bite and it will freeze you more than this weather does.
Red Cake?
Did you know that red cakes heal you? I'm 90%% sure that this is one of those cakes.
Hot Cake?
Play a prank on your friends with this really hot cake!
Cakes are truly the best when made with apples!
Fuschia Cake
This mushroom tastes a bit better than any other around here, according to myself!
It's the quenchiest!
