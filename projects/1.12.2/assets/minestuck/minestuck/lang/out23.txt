Adapt Entry Block Height
When on, you will be moved up on entry enough to make the top transferred non-air block placed at y:128 and all blocks above it ignored. (Which shouldn't be troubling as the ignored blocks should be handled as air) This will however make the entering the medium take slightly longer time.

"Operators, Creative and Spectator": Only non-op survival/adventure players are prevented from using the data checker. "Anyone": No access restrictions are used.
