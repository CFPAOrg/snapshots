To eat, or not to eat, that is the question.
All of the villagers here are trying to crack the mystery of how to make the frosted bread we see all day on our walks.
I heard all the cakes magically regenerate if you don't completely eat them! That's completely stupid!
Let's see, the recipe calls for 5 tbsp. of sugar, 2 tbsp. vanilla, 1 large grasshopper... what are you looking at?
If you're not careful, anything can set you on fire here, even the cakes!
When we start talking about cakes, the others start mentioning frosting. I'm not sure I get what they're talking about!
Legends say the giant gears were used for technology no consort has ever seen before. That's absurd! It's obviously food!
My neighbor says the gears are evil! He also said that swords are used for combat, so he's probably insane.
The ticking keeps me up all night. It keeps us all up all night. Save us.
We are thankful for all the frogs that They gave to us when the universe was created. They, of course, is the genesis frog. I feel bad for the fool who has to make another!
Ribbit, ribbit! I'm a frog! I don't care what you say!
Most people believe there aren't that many types of frogs. 4740, maybe? Anything beyond that would be proposterous.
Here in %s, however, we know that there are 9.444731276889531e+22 types of frogs.
For whatever reason, residents of Derse HATE frogs! Why would someone hate frogs?
My brother found a magic grasshopper while fishing recently!
Usually all we find are rings!
The frogs around here are all so gay! Look at them happily hopping about!
Some may call our land lewd, but the buckets are just so fun to swim in!
The buckets are a great source of water, as long as you pick the ones with water...
Did you know that some buckets provide warmth? I tend to curl up next to one from time to time.
Did you know that the buckets sometimes hold something other than oil?
In some cases, they even contain something drinkable!
