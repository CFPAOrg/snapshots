God, it's bright. Half of our village is blind. It's beginning to become a serious problem.
Our best village doctors found that staying outside in the blinding light for too long is not good for us. Most of us stay inside all our lives. It's sad.
Are you staring at me? No, really! I can't see because I'm blind.
You'd better wear sunglasses, else you might not see where you're going.
This is not the best place to wander blindly in.
You would think that the light would melt more snow.
But nope, the snow stays as frozen as ever!
Isn't it wonderful how much the snow is glimmering in the light?
Isn't it wonderful how much the sand is glimmering in the light?
Those light pillars... they somehow make me think of the legend of the wyrm.
This is a great place for murder. No one will hear you scream.
This place is so quiet and peaceful. Too bad we can't hear underlings about to kill us.
Shhh, they can hear you...
Just kidding, no one can hear you! The land itself muffles your words!
The sense of calmness in the air, it's kind of unnerving!
Climb up high and you'll be up for a great view!
I'd climb up one of those towers and look at the view, but I am scared of heights.
I mean, what if I slipped and fell off the stairs?
I'd climb up one of those rocks and look at the view, but I am scared of heights.
I mean what if I fell down and landed on my back?
AAH, I am scared of heights!
Someone's gotta be farmin' all these goddamn fuckin' mushrooms, pain in the ass through truly it be.
So that's what I'm doing.
Standing around here.
farmin' all these
goddamn
fuckin
mushrooms
Do you put glow mushrooms on your pizza or leave them off?
Put them on
I put them on!
Good! I was afraid I'd have to kill you!
Leave them off
I leave them off!
You are a despicable person.
Our land is a fire waiting to happen! Hopefully there isn't any lightning!
Is it getting hot in here or is it just me?
