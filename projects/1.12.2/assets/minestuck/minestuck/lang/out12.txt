Ever soaked your grist candies in the liquids the buckets contain? It really enhances the taste!
Tick Tock, time's a-wasting! Eat something or leave!
Take your mind off of the limited time we have left alive with food!
I'm selling recipes I made from a nearby library's cookbook. Buy some!
Who needs cake when you have crickets!
Crickets are nocturnal so our species' main food source is hard to find here. Oh well!
This place used to be filled with the sounds of crickets until we captured them all for food!
You're not you when you're hungry. Buy a snickers!
I HOPE you're hungry!
You hear a faint ba-dum tss in the distance.
We would never eat frogs here in the %s! Grasshoppers, though...
You hungry? I bet you are! Why else would you be talking to me?
Welcome to MacCricket's, what would you like?
Thank you for choosing Stop and Hop, this village's #1 one grocer!
Welcome. I hope you find something tasty among our wares.
The breeze has brought me many fine wares.
I accept payment in blood. And boondollars. I also take checks.
Twenty years selling losers hats and shit really takes the life out of you.
With my prices, my competitors are doomed!
Get your frog merchandise here! Limited time only! ....Just kidding, I'm always here.
Here's a witty one-liner tying in buckets and general stores!
Future me has told me that some sucker would buy tons of "goods" from me... will that sucker be you?
Books have taught us how to sell as much useless crap as possible, want some?
Don't buy goods here. Cake is our specialty, not general goods. Very low quality.
You may be blind but I'm sure you can see our prices are fantastic!
This land may be silent but our prices will make you SCREAM!... with joy, of course!
Other store's prices are INFURIATING! Our prices, however, will soothe that frustration!
I got the goods; they're all recently raided from a nearby tower!
We have generic goods for generic people!
