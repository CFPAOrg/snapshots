Been to the shop? They've got the best %s in the area!
I used to be an adventurer like you, then I never got the disks.
Beware the man who speaks in hands, wait...wrong game.
Maybe you should do something more productive than talking to NPCs.
I like crumpled hats, they're comfy and easy to wear!
We would love to invite you, %s, to our secret wizards cult.
Meet me by dawn with mercury, salt, and sulfur to begin the initiation.
Secret wizards? Th-there are no secret wizards! Wh-what're you speaking of, o-outlandish traveller?
I bought a bunch of stocks on the market... Now I'm broke...
Please, I need to pay for my children to attend college...
Wow, you have so many boondollars! I'll never make that much in my short, amphibious lifetime.
They are coming...
Huh? 'Who the fuck is They'? What kind of question is that?! I don't know! Who the fuck are you?
I heard that the true name of the %s is %s. Isn't that cool?
Hey there! I've got a wonderful item here for just 1000 boondollars? How about it kid?
This consort is way too nice to ever scam you! Surely you can trust them?
Buy "Wonderful item" [Pay 1000 boondollars]
Sure! Why not?
 Here you are!
Do not buy from cheery salesman.
No thanks! I'm short on cash.
Oh! No worries! How about I sell it to you for just 500 boondollars instead??
Still do not buy from cheery salesman.
I'm sorry, I meant *really* short on cash...
Buy that cheap item! [pay 500 boondollars]
Sure! I'd be glad to!
Thank you for your money!
It's a wonderful day. Hopefully some monster underneath the planet's surface doesn't eat us all!
I heard a floating island just appeared somewhere near here recently and falling chunks destroyed a village underneath it!
My brother found a magic ring while fishing recently!
Frog, it's such a wonderful day to just walk around a village.
Holy leapin' god, you have such wonderful hair! Can I eat some?
I feel like our king just sits around doing nothing but eating weird glowing mushrooms! So lazy!
