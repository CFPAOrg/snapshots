I invented music, y'kno! My favorite song goes like ba ba dum, dum ba dum.
Legends speak of the Wyrm, a giant ivory pillar that radiates joy and happiness and uselessness.
You smell kind of... heroic... like a hero, perhaps? It makes me kinda nervous to be around you!
You smell like you're leeching from the success from another hero... is this true?
I challenge you to a rap battle! Accept challenge? Y/N
Accept this consort's challenge!
Y! I'll take you on! You can even go first.
Don't bother with this guy.
N. Maybe later.
Maybe one day I will find a challenger worthy of my greatness....
I see you carryin' a pick
You think you minin'? Sick
But uh...
you ain't. Word.
You're green and square, kinda beveled on the sides
And the corners I guess. Or are they called vertexes?
But I'm sayin' you're generic. Like, so generic
it doesn't make sense. ... uh, sorry for being a jerk.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.
%1$s. %1$s. %1$s. %1$s.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I'm the Knight of Time, the god of sick beats
Settle down and lemme... why are you giving me that look?
This is my own original rap!
Really!
Incaseyoucouldn'ttell,
you'reuglyandyousmell!
OOOHHHHHHHHH!
...That's how rap works, right?
Have a nice trip and I'll see you next fall!
I hope you don't mind that my house isn't tall,
'Cuz them things is dang'rous and although no one cares,
I'm tellin' ya, dawg, I WARNED YOU 'BOUT STAIRS!
... that rap was really awful.
Schoo' that foo'!
All right, now it's my turn.
The %s proceeded to drop sick fire unlike any the %s had ever seen before.
%s. You are the greatest rapper ever.
Let the poor guy think they won.
... wow. I'm just... not going to try to go against something like that.
%s, yes! I am the greatest rapper ever!
Thip

Here, in the %s, we %s worship the %s. We wait and hope for the day that they awaken.
Sometimes, I look up in the sky to see Skaia and wish I could visit there some day...
