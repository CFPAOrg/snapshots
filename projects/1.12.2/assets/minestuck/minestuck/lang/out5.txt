Have you ever had a lava-roasted cricket? The lava really brings out the cricket juices.
You'd better watch where you're going. Wouldn't want you to step right into some fire.
We figured out how to treat the wood to make it less flammable. I hope we didn't miss a spot.
Be careful not to walk barefoot here, you could get a splinter!
Some of our kind have died due to the amount of splinters they received while on a walk.
Ah, the mildew on the grass in the morning makes the landscape so pretty!
Frog, don't you love the feeling of mycelium on your toes?
No? Is that just me?
At first, no one liked the mushrooms when our planet was cursed with the Dank.
Those who refused to adapt to the new food source Perished, obviously.
It's so damp and cold! I wish I had a jacket!
Curse %s! And curse all their mushrooms, too! I miss eating crickets instead of all these mushrooms!
According to legends of old, the %s will come one day and get the evil %s to clear up all this fungus!
Sand-surfing is my new favorite sport! Too bad you can't really move, though.
Want to buy a used camel? Only 2000 boondollars.
Why not? Seems like a good price for a camel!
Sure!
Hahaha! Sucker! I have no camel! Cya later! 8)
Of course not! You know better!
Not at all!
Are you sure? Too bad! The camel knew how to dance, too!
I kind of feel like we're a stale, knockoff sand land.
According to legend, %s ate all the sand here leaving nothing but sandstone!
I'm kidding, I made that up on the spot. I had no other dialogue.
Red is much better than yellow, don't you think?
In our village, we have tales of monsters that are atttracted to red. That's why everything is yellow!
My neighbors were complaining the other night about the snow.
Personally, the cold never really bothered me anyways.
You hear a faint "ba-dum tss" in the distance.
Darn! I only need 100 more boondollars for a nice, fur coat! Iâ€™m going to freeze!
