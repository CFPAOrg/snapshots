OH MY %s! I'M ACTUALLY ON SKAIA!
Oh my...! I'm actually on skaia!
You know, I have actually visited skaia at one point!
I sense the presence of the %s. Tell me if you see them, ok?
Present yourself as the %s.
I am the %s.
OH MY %s
"Agree" to do that.
Hehe, ok I will.
Hey kid... I'll give you something special for 1000 boondollars...
This consort seems pretty shady. You're not sure whether or not to trust them...
Buy "Something special" [Pay 1000 boondollars]
Ok... Sure??
Here, kid.
Do not buy from the shadowy dealer.
Uh, no thanks...
You're missin' out kiddo. %s it. I'll sell you this thing for 500 boondollars.
It may be a deception, do not buy the "thing"!
I said no already.
buy it already! [Pay 500 boondollars]
 Sure! Fine! Ok! Jeez...
Thanks for your cash.
%s has been sleeping for a thousand years. I shudder at the thought of their return.
What?
The... what?
The Denizen is the One that Slumbers in our very soil. It is eternally waiting for the %s to awaken it. Then they will be given The Choice, and their victory will be determined by what they choose.
Ask if the denizens are bad or not.
Were these 'denizens' bad?
How am I supposed to know if they were good or bad? There's more to a living being than just black and white!
I'm hungry. Have any bugs? Maybe a chocolate chip cookie? Mmm.
A %s! Could I have some?
Yes
Sure, here.
No
I don't really want to give this away.
Thank you! I will remember your kindness for the rest of my short life.
But I am starving here! What if I paid you 10 boondollars for it?
Sure
Sure, I can agree to that.
Too Cheap
I won't let it go that cheap.
Finally!
You are given 10 boondollars for the %s.
Fine. I will just go and find a real food store.
It's hard to catch our food with the Breeze carrying them away and whatnot!
Hope you like red meat!
Rabbit stew! Mmmm!
Lightning-smoked meat really adds to the flavor!
Frog legs are good but eating them is heresy! Buy some of our food instead!
