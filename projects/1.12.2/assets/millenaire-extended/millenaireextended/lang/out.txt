Frank Sigmar's Diary #1

How did I get here? What is this place? Everything seems to be... blocky. Everything is made out of squares! Even I am a square! What is this place and how did I ended up being here?

I don't quite remember how it happened, but suddenly there were others. Something was not right about this place. I came here to trade. I wanted to earn enough Deniers so I can make it back to England. But now, everyone was staring at me. Everyone was... Frank Sigmar.
