Elemental Arts
What is a system that allows for manipulation of the world's properties if it didn't include some good old fashioned elemental themed magic?<br><br>This group contains Tricks for the four elements. The red piece of this group is "Trick: Smite", which creates a lightning bolt at the position passed in. The other tricks also do things of the sort.<br><br>The group also contains "Operator: Random", a piece that will generate a random number between 0 (inclusive) and the number passed in (exclusive). This can be used alongside Loopcast or Spell Circle spells in many ways. For example, one can create a spell that would use "Trick: Overgrow" to mass bone meal a plantation.
Greater Infusion
The ability to infuse Diamonds into Psigems is very important in the progress of spellslinging. Using Psigems, stronger Rod components can be created. Similarly to "Trick: Infusion", "Trick: Greater Infusion" will infuse nearby Diamonds, turning them into Psigems.<br><br>Furthermore, "Trick: Ebony And Ivory" will infuse Coal into an Ebony Substance and Nether Quartz into an Ivory Substance, both of which can be combined with a Psimetal Ingot to create the respective alloy. These alloys can later be used to create stronger Rod Frames. "Trick: Ebony And Ivory" can only be used while in the End. 
Tool Casting
Psimetal and Psigems can be crafted into a Toolset: Shovel, Pickaxe, Axe and Sword.<br><br>These tools can be socketed with up to 3 Spell Nodes. When their relative action is executed, that being breaking a block for tools or attacking a mob for the sword, the selected spell is activated. The spell in a Psimetal tool is selected the same way as a Rod. A fourth slot is also shown in the radial menu in case one wants to disable the tool's spells entirely. Psimetal tools will slowly regenerate and restore their damage using the player's Psi energy, in bursts, as long as the tool isn't the item currently in the player's hand.<br><br>Spells in a tool aren't casted by the tool, but rather by the Rod, therefore, the limitations imposed by the Rod's stats still stand.<br><br>This group introduces a few runes that can be used in conjuction with the tools. The red piece of this group, "Selector: Block Broken" is meant to be used with tools, and gets you a vector respective to where you broke the block in the world. "Selector: Block Broken Side" gets the side in which you broke that block.<br><br>Lastly "Selector: Attack Target" does exactly as it sounds, it gets you the entity you attacked with a sword when the spell is casted. It can also be used with Projectile Spell Nodes, to get the entity that the projectile collided against, if any.
