Tutorial 4
Do you like explosions? Of course you do. Let's make a spell that explodes the block the player is looking at.<br><br>For this, we are going to need "Trick: Explode". This takes a Vector and a Number Constant. Similarly to our "Trick: Add Motion", this constant is the power of the trick. The vector is where you want the explosion to happen. We already used "Operator: Entity Look", but that gives us a vector that's very short. If we used that, the explosion would happen in our face! Instead, we want to use an "Operator: Vector Raytrace".<br><br>This operator takes a position and a ray, both Vectors. From the position, which will be the player's position, acquirable through "Operator: Entity Position", the operator extends the "Ray" parameter vector until it collides with a block in the world. (Note: "Operator: Entity Position" returns a vector whose Y value is 1.6 higher than usual if used on a player.)<br>Therefore, if we use it alongside "Operator: Entity Look", we can find out where the player is looking at and create our explosion there.One thing we have to keep in mind is the fact that spells are to a range of 32 blocks from their focal point, in our case, the player casting the spell. Our explosion can't be farther than 32 blocks away from the player.<br><br>Lastly, the "Error Suppressor" piece does exactly as it describes. If something goes wrong while casting your spell, you'll get an error in your chat telling you what went wrong. Sometimes that can get annoying, when you know a spell has a possible failiure state. In that case. throw in an "Error Suppressor" anywhere in your spell's grid and all the errors will be gone.<br><br>This will be your last basic tutorial, from here you'll be able to pick between various things to pick as you level up. Have fun!
Numbers 101
Numbers are an essential component to Spell Inscribing. These are basic arithmetic operators that can be used for math in spells.<br><br>If you don't have anything that uses numbers yet, try adding up two constants for a Debug trick.<br><br>Make sure to take note the difference between "Number" and "Number Constant" when holding Shift on any spell piece. A parameter that requires a "Number Constant" can't take a "Number", but a parameter that requires a "Number" can take a "Number" or a "Number Constant".
