Finished downloading %s. Delete your old Psi .jar and reload your game to update.
You already downloaded the latest version. Close your game, delete the old version from your mods folder and load it again to update!
The update is already downloading, give it some time, will you?
Woah! It seems like something went wrong while trying to download the Psi update. Is psi.vazkii.us down?
Sorry. This feature is currently disabled due to server host problems, it should be back soon.
