Psimetal Infusion
Psimetal is an important component to creating Focusing Rods with better Psi conduction. The "Trick: Infusion" piece executes a release of psionic energy similar to that of a cast with no nodes, except more concentrated and focused.<br><br>The piece takes no parameters, and functions the exact same manner as infusing Redstone to create Psidust does. To infuse Psimetal, drop Gold Ingots around, and cast a spell with "Trick: Infuse".<br><br>Psimetal can not only be used to create more powerful Rod components, but also to create Mindful Scrolls. Mindful Scrolls function as a method of storing and transporting spells between various Inscriber blocks. To write a Spell onto a Mindful Scroll, simply shift-right click it on the Spell Inscriber. After the scroll has a spell, doing the same thing will set the spell on the inscriber instead. To remove the spell from the scroll, shift-right click the air.<br><br>Lastly, Mindful Scrolls can be copied by placing an empty one and a written one together in a crafting grid.  
Movement Advances
Movement and transport is a topic already addressed via the usage of "Trick: Add Motion". This group includes runes that improve on that concept.<br><br>"Trick: Blink" is the red piece of this group, and all it does is simply teleport the target entity wherever they're looking at forwards by the constant value passed in. A negative value will teleport the entity backwards. "Trick: Mass Blink" does the same as "Trick: Blink", but focused on an Entity List, having all of them be affected by the trick.<br><br>"Trick: Mass Add Motion" is self-explanatory, it's an Entity List version of "Trick: Add Motion", adding the same motion to every entity in the list.<br><br>Lastly, "Trick: Mass Exodus" moves every entity in an Entity List to a given position, with the given speed. Negative speed will move them away.
