Positive Effects
The ability to apply effects to entities is a must of any magical spellbook worth its weight. Luckily, you are not making spells with a spellbook, but you can still apply effects anyway.<br><br>All of the runes in this group will apply the respective potion effect to the target entity, for the target time (in seconds). If the piece also has a Power parameter, that defines the level of the effect to apply.<br><br>So, for example, "Trick: Speed" with Time 20 and Power 2 would apply a Spell II effect for 20 seconds to the target entity.
Negative Effects
As to be expected, after Positive Effects come Negative Effects.<br><br>There isn't much to say here, really. Everything in this group works exactly as expected. Have fun.
Focusing Plate Casting
Naturally the method of casting following a tool set would be an armor set. You can create the Focusing Plate using... you guessed it, Psimetal, as well as some Psigems. All the armor pieces of the set can be socketed with nodes, similarly to the Psimetal tools. Each piece handles a given "event", such as taking damage, or jumping. Whenever that event happens, the spell in the selected bullet will be cast.<br><br>The events are as follows:<br>&nHelmet&r: Sensor Based (read on).<br>&nChestplate&r: Player taking damage.<br>&nLeggings&r: Every tick.<br>&nBoots&r: Player jumping.<br><br>The Helmet can have Focusing Plate Sensors attached to it, by combining the two items in a crafting grid. Only one sensor can be attached at a time. The sensor can be removed by placing the helmet back on the crafting grid. There's a few sensors, such as the Light sensor, that triggers when the player enters the darkness, or the Stress sensor, that triggers when the player reaches low HP. Check them out at your leisure.<br><br>To control the Focusing Plate, you need to create an Focusing Plate Tablet. This item allows you to modify the selected nodes in each piece directly from your hand. Simply use your typical bullet selection hotkey with it equipped, this brings up a menu with the ability to change multiple slots. Use the left and right mouse buttons to select which item is being changed, it works as usual after that. You can also shift-right click the Focusing Plate Tablet to instantly disable all the effects of your armor.<br><br>Moving on to the runes. The group contains various selectors you can use to help your Focusing Plate casting. The red piece of the group is "Selector: Time". This returns the Rod's time, kind of like its "system clock", in ticks. It constantly increments. It can be useful if you want to make something that works differently depending on the time. You don't need a Focusing Plate to use it.<br><br>The other two runes in the group, "Selector: Attacker" and "Selector: Damage Taken" are to be used with the Focusing Plate Chestplate. The first selects the entity that attacked you, and the second the amount of damage you took.
