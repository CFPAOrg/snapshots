Block Conjuration
This group includes runes that do exactly as advertised, they conjure blocks.<br><br>The red piece of the group, "Trick: Conjure Block" creates a Conjured Block at the given position. A Conjured Block is a semi-transparent, physical block that can, optionally, if the "Time" parameter is specified, disappear from the world after a bit. If the "Time" parameter is used, it's specified in Ticks. For those unaware, a Tick is equivalent to 1/20th of a second, so if you want to make a block that disappears after half a second, set "Time" to 10 ticks.<br><br>"Trick: Conjure Light" conjures a light source instead, one that can't be collided against. "Trick: Conjure Block Sequence" functions much like "Trick: Place Block Sequence", but creates Conjured Blocks instead. Both these runes also include the very same "Time" parameter.<br><br>The color of the Conjured Blocks created is equal to that of the Varnish used in the Rod (or the default light blue case none is present). Varnishes whose color changes, such as the Rainbow varnish will also reflect in the visuals of the Conjured Blocks.
Eidos Manipulation
Eidos Spells allow for the caster to manipulate the space-time continuum in their favor.<br><br>The red piece of this group, "Trick: Eidos Reversal" retraces the caster's steps, at double speed, for the amount of time (in seconds) specified. Only one Reversal may be active at a time, and after a Reversal is cast, the effect of any subsequent cast is only available until the point where the last one ended. Sneaking will stop an ongoing Reversal.<br><br>The other trick piece of the group, "Trick: Eidos Anchor" creates an "anchor" effect on the caster. After the target amount of time (in seconds), the caster will be taken back to where their anchor was. Multiple casts of "Trick: Eidos Anchor" can be done, but only the last one will take effect.<br><br>Lastly "Selector: Eidos Changelog" takes a single number parameter (let's call it n), and gives you the position in the n'th index of the Eidos Changelog starting from the end. In simpler terms, it gives you a vector equal to the position that the caster was n ticks ago. Remember that "Trick: Eidos Reversal" takes the caster back in the changelog, wiping out any info that would come after. "Trick: Eidos Anchor" does not modify the changelog.
