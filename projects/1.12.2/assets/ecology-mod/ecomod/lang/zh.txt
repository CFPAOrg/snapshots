Dropped food items and crop drops are absorbing pollution from the environment unless they're isolated. When eaten these items will cause bad potion effects.
Pollution in the air when combined with water particles forms a dense fog which poisons living creatures. To prevent poisoning put on a respirator. Make sure you have filters!
Because of air pollution you sleeping here makes you sick.
When sleeping you can be poisoned by the polluted air.
Because of the pollution fish cannot live in the water. Fishing is futile.
Because of high water pollution, water turns into polluted water, making it poisonous and almost useless.
Because of strong pollution, tree leaves deteriorate and decay.
Saplings can grow into trees no more in this region.
The rain mixed with pollution produces an acid rain. When raining it will poison any living creature if the one isn't wearing a helmet(helmet is damaged instead). Also the rain dissolves leaves and farmland.
The area turns into lifeless wasteland, grass turn into dirt and sand, the biome color changes to dark, entities defined as "creature" or "water creature" can no longer spawn there. 
Because soil pollution is too great, soil deteriorates. Thus the dirt cannot be plowed and farmland turns into dirt. 
Because of harsh environmental conditions animals can spawn no more here.
Because soil is oversaturated with poisonous substances fertilizers do not have an effect.
Crops can grow no more here, but you still can fertilize them with bonemeal unless you have a bonemeal restricting effect.
