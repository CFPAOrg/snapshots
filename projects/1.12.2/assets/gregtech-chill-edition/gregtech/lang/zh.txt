Multiblock Pattern
The Primitive Blast Furnace (PBF) is multiblock structure used for cooking steel in early game stage. Although not being very fast, it will provide your with steel for your first setups.
The Coke Oven is multiblock structure used for getting coke and creosote in early game stage. It doesn't require fuel and has internal tank of 32 buckets of creosote. Inventory can be accessed via Coke Oven Hatch.
The Vacuum Freezer is multiblock structure mainly used for freezing Hot Ingots into regular Ingots. However, it can also freeze other substances, such as Water.
The Implosion Compressor is a multiblock structure that uses explosives to turn gem dusts into the corresponding gems.
The Pyrolyze Oven is a multiblock structure used for turning Logs into Charcoal and Creosote Oil, or Ash and Heavy Oil.
The Cracker Unit is a multiblock structure used for turning Light and Heavy Fuel into their Cracked variants.
The Diesel Engine is a multiblock structure that acts as a Diesel Generator for EV power.
The Distillation Tower is a multiblock structure used for distilling the various types of Oil and some of their byproducts.
The Electric Blast Furnace (EBF) is multiblock structure used for smelting alloys, cooking metals and refining ores. It is required for obtaining high-tier alloys and metals, such as aluminium, stainless steel and titanium, naquadah alloy.
The Multi Smelter is multiblock structure used for smelting massive amounts of items at once. Different tiers of coils provide speed boost and energy efficiency gain. 16 is base value of items smelted per operation, and can be multiplied by using higher level coils.
Large Boilers are multiblocks that generate steam from energy source and water. Usually either solid fuel or some high-density fluid acts like energy source for large boiler. Tiers differ only by amount of steam outputted.
Large Turbines are multiblocks that generate power from steam, gases and plasma by them spinning turbine's rotor. Energy output is based on rotor efficiency and current speed of turbine.
By changing drill head types of the Bedrock Drilling Unit, you can increase the tier to get even better materials. These materials are mined from the core of the earth.

Fusion Reactor
Fusion Reactor [Mark II]
The Fusion Reactor is a large multiblock structure used for fusing elements into heavier ones. The Mark 1 Fusion Reactor can use LuV, ZPM or UV Energy Hatches./nFor every Hatch it has its buffer increases by 100k.
The Fusion Reactor Mark 2 is a large multiblock structure used for fusing elements into heavier ones./nThe Mark 2 Fusion Reactor can only use UV Energy Hatches./nFor every Hatch it has its buffer increases by 200k.
Bedrock Drill
The Assembly Line is a large multiblock structure consisting of 5 to 16 "slices"./nIn theory, it's a large Assembler, used for creating advanced crafting components.
