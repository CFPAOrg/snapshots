Each Coolant has there own Max Temperature, If the Temperature of The Reactor exceed the max temperature the reactor cooldown by Stoping the recipe.
The Core of the reactor can be Nuclear Material and higher tier add more thermal flexibility to the Coolant.
Tips 1: Pump is a must have in this build to regulate coolant otherwise the core will stay cool and never produce hot coolant.
Tips 2: Coolant is in a closed loop, Hot Coolant turbine output Coolant.
Hatches and Buses can be placed anywhere on Lead Casing.

The Void Ore Miner will produce tons of ores.
It will consume Pyrotheum and Cryotheum alternatively each sec.
Temperature will increase if there is only Pyrotheum and will decrease if there is only Cryotheum.
First step, will be to only feed with Pyrotheum and then, when the temperature is a the perfect spot, slowly add Cryotheum.
If temperature is above the max temperature the Void Ore Miner will stop working and slowly cool down.
Large Transformer can convert any GTEU/AMPS by any GTEU/AMPS.
The Industrial Primitive Blast Furnace is a large multiblock structure consisting of 1 to 64 "slices".
It's the upgraded version of The Primitive Blast Furnace.
The Industrial Primitibe Blast Furnace can be automate and speed up.
Will produce Cobblestone, Andesite, Diorite and Granite. have to be ajacent to lava and water.
The Cryogenic Freezer is built as the Vacuum Freezer. It consume 20L of Cryotheum per sec and it is 2x faster and process 4 items at one time.
The Advanced Distillation Tower is built as the the Distillation Tower with 26 layer.
2 Modes :
Duration Depend on Coil Tier.
The Large Rocket Engine will produce large amounts of power.
It will consume Rocket Fuel as quickly as you can supply it.
