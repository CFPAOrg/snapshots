Consume 37500mB of Air and 10mB of Carbon Dioxide per Second .
Use Liquid Hydrogen to boost by 3 the output energy (4mB/second /2048 EU/t)
Default Efficiency is 60%%.
Above LuV is 40%%
Above ZPM is 20%%
Above UV is 10%%
Quicker than the Blast Furnace
The Large Naquadah Reactor has no efficiency loss.
Some Naquadah fuels react with Potassium Plasma and Produce more than 1UV.
The Battery Tower is a large multiblock battery that can store large amounts of EU.
All the cells in the tower need to be of the same tier and the tower will drain 10%% of the cells voltage per tick.
The input/output hatches can not be of a higher tier than the tier of the cells.
