Max Attenuation By Angle
After duration is attenuated by distance, it will be further attenuated depending on the angle (in degrees) between the eye/looking direction and the eye/grenade direction. This is done by multiplying it by 1 (no attenuation) if the angle is 0; and by this value if the angle is the maximum within the angle of effect.
Raytrace Opaque Blocks
If true, the effect is only applied if the line between the eyes and the grenade does not intersect any non-liquid blocks with an opacity greater than 0.
Projectile Spread
Properties relating to projectile spread
Spread Threshold
The amount of time in milliseconds before logic to apply spread is skipped. The value indicates a reasonable amount of time before a weapon is considered stable again.
Max Count
The amount of times a player has too shoot within the spread threshold before the maximum amount of spread is applied. Setting the value higher means it will take longer for the spread to be applied.
