Baubles
The mod that adds several convenient new accessory slots to your player is also able to store the rings and pendants that are offered in this book. They still keep working as if they were inside your inventory. Baubles for everyone!
Blood Magic
One day I discovered a very strange &1Blood Orb&0 that must have been owned by some kind of &1Magician&0. When using it I felt like I was somehow connected to it. After a while I discovered that it was in fact connected to my &4Blood&0 stream. By forcing a large amount of &4Blood&0 through it using the &1Blood Infuser&0, I've managed to create an item that is both connected to my &4Blood&0 stream and can be used as a simple container, allowing me to place it in my favorite machines and using it with my items.
Equivalent Exchange 3
Magicians have discovered that almost all things in this world have some kind of &1value&0 relative to other things. These people have mastered the act of &1transmuting&0 these things to each other. Their strange methods even seem to work with my items.
Forestry
When &ovisiting&r some of my friends working with trees and bees, I noticed that some of their bags allow me to insert some of my items. I also noticed that their machine called the &1Squeezer&0 is able to extract &4Blood&0 from parts of the &1Undead Tree&0, which can be easily grown using their tree growing system.
Ender IO
These Ender-based technologies are very interesting, perhaps I could improve my machines based on that at some point. Eitherway, I seem to be able to process &1Dark Ore&0 and &1Dark Gems&0 using their machines, which is quite useful.
Industrial Craft 2
There is a group of odd people who constantly work with buzzing machines. I have no idea what these machines do, except for the &1Macerator&0. I am able to insert &1Dark Ore&0 into it to immediately retrieve &1Dark Gems&0 and their crushed variant. Regular &1Dark Gems&0 can also be inserted to crush.
