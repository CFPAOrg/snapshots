Just Enough Items
Some people seem to have "&oToo Many Items&r", while others have "&oNot Enough Items&r". It seems like we finally reached a stage where people have "&oJust Enough Items&r", the knowledge from this book is understandable for them.
Immersive Engineering
I have to admit, the machines of those engineers look pretty neat. Other than that, they also appear to be very good in processing &1Dark Ore&0 and &1Dark Gems&0, but also in squeezing &1Undead Logs&0 and &1Undead Leaves&0 for &4Blood&0.
Thermal Expansion
These people are quite strange, they always wear very odd clothes and mostly seem to be wielding many types of wrenches for some reason. I know only one thing about them, they have a machine that can transpose fluids which allows for some very basic blood infusion, but unfortunately this can't be upgraded.
Thaumcraft
I have noticed Thaumaturgy to be a very different kind of magic. It looks like Thaumaturges are very happy when they see items of mine, they always walk around here with their strange hexagons. To please my friends, I have constructed some &1Veined Scribing Tools&0 which can be used to write with &4Blood&0 instead of ink.
Tinkers' Construct
&0Tools, tools and tools!&r It seems to be all these folks think about. Using nothing but these tools must damage them severely, luckily they have the &1Blood Chest&0 to repair them!
WAILA
What are you looking at, you ask? You should be able to tell, really.
