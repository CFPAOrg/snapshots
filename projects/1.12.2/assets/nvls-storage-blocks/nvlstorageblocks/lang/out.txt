The latest result of the subspace-technology research. This container can be tuned on a specific subspace frequency which allows it to send items through subspace into a §bSubspace Item-transporter Receiver §fcontainer.
This container is the pair of the §bSubspace Item-transporter§f. If tuned to the same frequency as the Sender it will receive the sent items through subspace.
This is the product of the latest subspace technology. The container creates a subspace bubble to store these extreme amount of stuff. It has 126 item slots which compared to a double chest's 54 is great. And occupies only 1 block space!\nJust plan carefully where to place it because you will need a few rounds to pick up everything when destroyed.
This is the ultimate subspace storage solution with §e1260 (!!!) §fstorage slots.
