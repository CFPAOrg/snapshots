An Egg laid by a Demon Moa. Hatching this provides a Demon Moa with 11 mid-air jumps, however it's speed is quite lackluster. This moa is quite... edgy for what it is. This can be used to kill Aechor Plants when tamed.
An Egg laid by a Chartreuse Moa. Hatching this provides a Chartreuse Moa with 5 mid-air jumps, and a small speed boost. This Moa is quite bright to the eye.
An Egg laid by an Aqua Moa. Hatching this provides an Aqua Moa with 7 mid-air jumps. It's color is quite soothing to the eyes.
An Egg laid by a Pink Moa. Hatching this provides a Pink Moa with 6 mid-air jumps. There's nothing quite unique about it besides it's looks. I mean look at that tounge...
