Additional Purification
Expanding on my earlier work with Metal Purification, I've also found a way to process some more exotic Minerals found in the world.
Immersive Engineering Purification
My latest experiments have resulted in a way to process Bauxite, Nickel, and Uranium into Native Clusters
Mimic Fork
Note Blocks are a device I've been thinking of a lot lately. They are simple things that respond to touch or Redstone to emit one single pure note... But of what utility are they really?<BR>Any usage requires a Note Block to be setup in a specific location and manually configured to the desired note.<BR>There must be a better way...
I've found my answer with Mimic Fork <BR>The Mimic Fork has a few functions, It can store musical notes to evoke them at a later point. It also allows you to set an Arcane Ear or Note Block's Note setting by Right-Clicking the Mimic Fork on either device. You are also able to set the Instrument and Note type of a given Note Block or Arcane Ear by instead Sneak-Right Clicking on the device.
Control Seal: Shear
I should be able to design a seal to allow the properly equipped golems to harvest wool from my sheep for me. I may need to see about attaching a shear of some sort to the golem's frame.
This seal allows a Smart Golem equipped with Claw Hands to shear animals within the range of the control seal.<BR>Any items generated this way are dropped at the golem's feet and will need to be collected for proper storage.
