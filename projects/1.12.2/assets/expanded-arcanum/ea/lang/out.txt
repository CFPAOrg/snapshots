Over the course of my research I've come to realize that I've only begun to scratch the surface of what is possible.<BR>I've turned my attention to augmenting other professions with Thaumaturgy with the hope of discovering some unforeseen breakthrough.
This crucible of mine has opened up some interesting possibilities including ways to fundamentally change the vary nature of objects. This is definitely worth further exploration...
I've decided to apply some of my research into Artifice to some of my other studies.
Artificial life! For ages the most advanced constructs in the world have been the hulking Iron Monstrosities seen around Villages, the ability to make smaller, more intelligent, and potentially more dangerous beings is definitely worth further research

Refining Drill Upgrade
While I've figured out how to enchant most mundane tools with Refining, the Mining Drill was a bit more trickier to accomplish. Rather than imbuing the Drill itself with the Refining Enchantment Matrix, I've decided to create a Drill Upgrade that holds the powers of the Enchantment. This upgrade can stack up to four times and enables the Drill to harvest Native Clusters from ores mined with the drill.
