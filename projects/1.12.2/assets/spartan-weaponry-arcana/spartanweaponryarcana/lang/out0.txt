Manasteel Weaponry
Mana-repairing Spartan Weaponry weapons 
With the ability to make more specialized weapons using mundane materials, it makes sense that &1Manasteel&0 would also be suitable to use for these weapons. Using &1Manasteel&0 also allows these specialist weapons to regenerate using mana from &1Mana Tablets&0 or &1Mana Pools&0.<br>Making these weapons require &1Livingwood Handles&0 or &1Livingwood Poles&0.

Terrasteel Weaponry
Just like specialized weapons made with &1Manasteel&0, the same weapons can be made using &1Terrasteel&0, which also have the same ability to regenerate using Mana using &1Mana Tablets&0 or &1Mana Pools&0.<br>Additionally, just like the &1Terra Blade&0, the weapon can send out a &4Mana Burst&0, which does damage equal to a melee attack. However, this doesn't work with Throwing or Ranged Weapons.
