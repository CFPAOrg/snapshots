Manasteel Weaponry
Mana-repairing Spartan Weaponry weapons 
With the ability to make more specialized weapons using mundane materials, it makes sense that &1Manasteel&0 would also be suitable to use for these weapons. Using &1Manasteel&0 also allows these specialist weapons to regenerate using mana from &1Mana Tablets&0 or &1Mana Pools&0.<br>Making these weapons require &1Livingwood Handles&0 or &1Livingwood Poles&0.

Terrasteel Weaponry
Just like specialized weapons made with &1Manasteel&0, the same weapons can be made using &1Terrasteel&0, which also have the same ability to regenerate using Mana using &1Mana Tablets&0 or &1Mana Pools&0.<br>Additionally, just like the &1Terra Blade&0, the weapon can send out a &4Mana Burst&0, which does damage equal to a melee attack. However, this doesn't work with Throwing or Ranged Weapons.

Elementium Weaponry
Making use of the exotic material &1Elementium&0 from &4Alfheim&0, it is now possible to make the same specialized weaponry that can be made from &1Manasteel&0 and &1Terrasteel&0.<br>This time however, &1Elementium&0 weapons require &1Dreamwood Handles&0 and &1Dreamwood Poles&0.

Thaumium Weaponry
I have uncovered a way to make specialized weapons from mundane materials.<BR>Now that I have Thaumium at my disposal, it should be easy just replacing the material used with Thaumium to make Thaumium weapons.
Void Weaponry
What a peculiar material.<BR>This Voidmetal, despite it seeming to be going against all that you learnt in your Thaumoturgical and Metallurgical studies so far, is suprisingly effective for weaponry.<BR>I'm thinking that maybe using this for more specialized weaponry might just do the trick.
I seriously think I might be losing my mind.<BR>This "Voidmetal", which should by all intents and purposes shouldn't even exist, is beyond unnatural. And yet, it's suprisingly effective for weaponry. I'm thinking that maybe using this for more specialized weaponry might just do the trick...<BR>Is the Voidmetal speaking to me?
