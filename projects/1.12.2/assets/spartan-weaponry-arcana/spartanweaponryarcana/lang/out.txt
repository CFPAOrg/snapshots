Thaumium Weaponry
I have uncovered a way to make specialized weapons from mundane materials.<BR>Now that I have Thaumium at my disposal, it should be easy just replacing the material used with Thaumium to make Thaumium weapons.
Void Weaponry
What a peculiar material.<BR>This Voidmetal, despite it seeming to be going against all that you learnt in your Thaumoturgical and Metallurgical studies so far, is suprisingly effective for weaponry.<BR>I'm thinking that maybe using this for more specialized weaponry might just do the trick.
I seriously think I might be losing my mind.<BR>This "Voidmetal", which should by all intents and purposes shouldn't even exist, is beyond unnatural. And yet, it's suprisingly effective for weaponry. I'm thinking that maybe using this for more specialized weaponry might just do the trick...<BR>Is the Voidmetal speaking to me?
