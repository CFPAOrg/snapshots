Reinforced glass that can be used in the Fusion Reactor multiblock.
A panel of Reactor Glass that is capable of absorbing optical energy and thereby heating up the Fusion Reactor.
The controlling block for the entire Fusion Reactor structure.
Reinforced framing that can be used in the Fusion Reactor multiblock.
A block that can be used to both block Fusion Reactor radiation and assist in the production of Tritium.
A block of reinforced framing that is capable of managing both the gas and energy transfer of the Fusion Reactor.
A block that can be used to allow basic monitoring of a reactor using redstone.
A strong mineral that can be found at nearly any height in the world. It is known to have many uses in the construction of machinery.
A common, conductive material that can be used in the production of wires. Its ability to withstand high heats also makes it essential to advanced machinery.
A lightweight, yet sturdy, conductive material that is found slightly less commonly than Copper.
