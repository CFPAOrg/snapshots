A machine that serves as an upgrade to regular machinery, allowing for multiple processing operations to occur at once.
A condensed, coiled resistor capable of converting electrical energy directly into heat energy.
A machine that uses energy to rapidly craft items and blocks from Crafting Formulas. Doubles as an advanced crafting bench.
A machine that is capable of producing large quantities of heat energy by burning combustible items.
A highly-advanced block capable of transmitting any practical resource across long distances and dimensions.
A generator that uses the heat of lava or other burnable resources to produce energy.
A generator that uses the power of the sun to produce energy.
A generator that harnesses the molecular varying gasses to produce energy.
A generator that burns organic materials of the world to produce energy.
An advanced generator that directly absorbs the sun's rays with little loss to produce energy.
A generator that uses the strength of the wind to produce energy, with greater efficiency at higher levels.
The steel rod that is used to house Turbine Blades within an Industrial Turbine.
A connector that is placed on the highest Turbine Rotor of an Industrial Turbine to carry kinetic energy into its Electromagnetic Coils.
A block that converts kinetic energy from a Rotational Complex into useable electricity. These can be placed in any arrangement above your Rotational Complex, as long as they are all touching each other and the complex itself.
Pressure-resistant casing used in the creation of an Industrial Turbine.
A type of Turbine Casing that includes a port for the transfer of energy and steam.
A type of Turbine Casing with an integrated vent for the release of steam. These should be placed on the level of or above the turbine's Rotational Complex.
A block that condenses steam processed by an Industrial Turbine into reusable water. These can be placed in any arrangement above your rotational complex.
