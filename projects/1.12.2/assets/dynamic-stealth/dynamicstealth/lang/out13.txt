Threat Bypass
FILLSCREEN FIXNEWLINES Entities in this bypass the threat system\n\nThis means they will not use the search AI, will appear with ???? as their target and threat level in the targeting HUD, and always appear as full alert in the on-point HUD\n\nFor some entities, this option is necessary for them to work right, such as slimes.  For others, like the ender dragon and other players, it has no effect besides how they appear in the HUD\n\nYou can also specify entities with a certain name, like so:\nmodid:entity:name\n \n
Passiveness
FILLSCREEN FIXNEWLINES Sets whether the threat system detects and entity as passive or not\n\nentityID, passivity\n\neg...\n\nminecraft:skeleton, true\n\nYou can also specify entities with a certain name, like so:\nmodid:entity:name\n \n
