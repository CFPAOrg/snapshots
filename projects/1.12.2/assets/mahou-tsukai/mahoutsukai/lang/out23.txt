Sympathetic Magic
Sympathetic Magic refers to a symbolic magic, in which a target can be affected remotely through the use of a symbol. %%n%%nTo use a scrying circle for sympathetic magic, it must be actively scrying something. Also, an inventory under the scrying circle must contain Kodoku worms to act as fuel. Worms with higher kodoku values will increase the chance of successful sympathetic magic.

Countering Sympathetic Magic
You can counter sympathetic magic against yourself by keeping a worm with a high kodoku value in your inventory. The higher the value, the less likely the magic will succeed against you, and there's even a chance it will be reflected to the caster.
