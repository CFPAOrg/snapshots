Leylines
Leylines connect certain points throughout the world. They can only be seen with Mystic Eyes of Fay Sight.

The Fae
The Fae are spiritlike creatures that spawn near leylines. Like leylines, they can also only be seen with Mystic Eyes of Fay Sight. Their laughter sounds like bells, and they drop Fae Essence upon death.%%n%%n The Fae are particularly attracted to magic being performed on leypoints. %%n%%nThey are breedable through the use of any Powdered Catalyst.
Fae Essence
Fae Essence is dropped by the fae. Right clicking with fae essence will place a fae circle. Scrolls and stationary circles created by fae essence can be used by anyone. You can claim a fae circle by right clicking it, and it will drain mana from you when used. Most importantly, because Fae Essence is not bound to a user, it is ideal for automated scroll creation.
