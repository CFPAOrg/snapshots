This peculiar shield can help you a lot in fights against your enemies, in fact you can easily hold right-click to block damage and to become invisible, from that moment on as long as you hold right click mobs won't notice you. When you release right-click the lemurite shield will be on a cooldown for a period of time depending on the time you used the shield. There's a shield use limit of 30 seconds after which the shield is automatically put on cooldown.
Thermite dust can be melted in Tinkers' Construct's smeltery and then used in the smeltery tank to fuel it, this enhanced fuel allows you to melt ores you couldn't smelt before and to smelt usual ores way faster than when you use lava. If you don't have Tinkers' Construct installed you can use it as a powerful fuel for any machines with enhanced results if used on Metallurgy Machines
The Krik Armor makes you float at a certain height depending on how much filled your inventory is. You can press the UP arrow or the DOWN arrow to float respectively up and down.  You have a height limit you can't go over while floating, that limit depends on how full your inventory is (excluding the hotbar). There's also an HUD in the bottom-right corner of the screen that shows you, your height level and your limit.
