These staves do have some minor problems, since they are two handed tools I often find myself striking my foes in close quarters. The current iron caps for the staff are effective but I believe that I will be able to improve on this by using other metals such as gold.
Perhaps gold was not the best choice for the caps, indeed after some investigation I believe that the infused metal I have been creating will work much better than any of my previous attempts.
Thanks to my continual use of Arcane Chalk I believe I have an idea of how I could develop an improved version of it that automatically replenishes itself as it is used.
Staves have proven themselves to be effective casting tools. However due to their two-handed nature they aren't as versatile as I would like, thus I have designed a smaller casting implement that can be used in one hand, it has a couple of drawbacks but on the whole could still be useful to me.
My current methods of spell casting are effective although there is a great level of inconvenience, having to swap out focusing crystals constantly. These pages speak of an alternative way of spell casting, by carving a stone in an appropriate manner I will be able to use it as a casting device with the ability to hold multiple foci at once. §nRight click to equip a focus from inventory, shift + scroll to switch to next focus slot, shift + secondary effect + scroll to detach current focus.§r
My research into the transmutation of stones has revealed an alternative medium to carve Runestones out of. This has a much greater strength and will be able to hold an additional three foci.
Through continued use of my Arcane Workbench I believe that I can improve on my design, with the addition of some storage space I may well be able to improve the efficiency of my crafting. I also believe I have discovered a new type of ritual, using books as the catalyst I can create an item that can be used to translate a single piece of research from the book.
