This page is hard to decipher, however I have seen the phrase §nElemental Crystals§r used a lot, perhaps I should be on the lookout for them, I imagine that once I have them in my hands things may start to make more sense.
The parts of these pages that I can understand suggest that I should try §nDrawing with the Chalk§r seems a bit strange to me however there is this symbol which I believe isn't just a letter that I could try drawing.
This is interesting, these pages suggest that there may be a §nRitual§r that can take this dust and turn it back into a crystal. I guess Monutan must have run into the same issue when collecting the crystals, anyway this seems to mention §nWater§r being used as a reagent of some sort.
The Arcane Basin is a useful device although the process is rather slow, perhaps with continued study of its use I may theorise a way of making it easier.
These elemental tools are pretty helpful however I suspect there may be a better medium for the powers which they hold, perhaps with some continued use of these effects I will find what I am looking for.
