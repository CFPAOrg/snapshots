The joys of Pinkcrafting
Always in a Slurry
Craft a bucket of Liquid Slime, a bucket of Toxic Slurry, and a bucket of Pinked Slurry. Slurries make very good mob traps.
Arley Bird!
Find and tame a Green Parrot. Cute ain't it?
Beanstalked
Plant a Lost Bean and grow a Beanstalk. Prepare for pain (and lotsa loot).
Becoming a Hacker
Forge a Hack Sword from dropped Seasoned Cudgel Shards. Whack! Whack! Off with their heads!
Club Membership
Handcraft a Mob-Luv Cudgel and demonstrate your affection for all creatures hostile until the cudgel is no more. Always collect the broken cudgel's shards!
Corrupted!
Farm some scary looking Sludge Grubs from slurry infested logs or cobblestone. Then corrupt a pack of innocent Pinkly Eggs.
Dark Options
Using your Heart Harvester, retrieve a corrupting Dark Tome treasure item from a Beanstalk.
Dust in the Potato
Extract the unique enzymic dusty goodness from the various wild potato subtypes. You'll need some: Altitude dust, Fecundity dust, and Cloaking dust.
