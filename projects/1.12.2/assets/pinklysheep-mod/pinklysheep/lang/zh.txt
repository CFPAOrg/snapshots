Use your stealth to fine-tune your macuahuitl skills by outwitting or just over-powering an additional 100 hostiles in hand-to-hand combat.
Warrior Noble (Leadership)

Hello, I am dropped animal poop. Do not be alarmed for I am the GOOD stuff. You are advised to collect as much of me as possible for use in your crop farming.
One of the new non-poo animal drops added by Pinkly Sheep. Pink sheep occasionally drop Pinkly Eggs and parrots will drop feathers. To get parrot eggs, you need one 'Papabird' and at least two 'Mamabird's.
One of the new ores or ore block drops added by Pinkly Sheep. You should find these ores in terrain and loot chests generated after the mod was installed.
One of the new hostile mob drops added by Pinkly Sheep. Lapis Fragments are dropped by witches, Quartz Fragments from witches and pigmen, Slime Droplets from slimes, and Silverfish Dust from silverfish.
One of the possible toxified crops or poisoned plants produced when you spam regular crops and flowers with Sludge Renew! Crops, grass, saplings require Silk Touch to harvest.
One of two new mushrooms that will spawn on Pinkly Mycelium naturally. You can generate these mushrooms yourself by applying Moo Shroo Poo to dirt directly.
Wild potatoes dropped by wild potato plants. Wild potato seedlings spawn occasionally when you apply Pinkly Poo to Dirty Dirt with water nearby. Needs Vanilla Food Pantry mod to extract enzymes to powders.
Decayed remains of fish or other sea creatures found in a recovered trawl crate. Use Putrid Fish to create chum bait for polar bears and guardians. Use Fish Bones for bonemeal.
Trawl crates that have been filled or are being filled by a trawl station. Occasionally you will dredge up old, damaged 'Lost+Found' sealed crates when fishing.
One of the new squirmy things added by Pinkly Sheep. Most easily obtained by breaking manure blocks, rotting logs and hay bales, or green waste. You can farm squirmies if you need large quantities.
One of the by-products you get from farming squirmies. All box-farmed squirmies produce slimy gunk. Earthworms can also produce vermimeal while larvae can produce sticky lil poops if given grass to eat.
Albino melon and rainbow slices. Albino melon seedlings will generate occasionally when you apply Pinkly Poo to a dirt or grass area. Expect a spawn rate of about 1 seedling per 32 attempts. Rainbow slices drop from albino melons.
Tainted Soul Sand sludge and Tainted Souls Warts. Create tainted soul sand sludge by placing soul sand in direct contact with toxic Pig Slurry. See wiki for detailed instructions on farming tainted souls and soul warts.
Icky oozy masses of squirmies you find in a thriving Box Farm. A single mass will contain several hundred squirmies (right-click the mass to disentangle them). Use as bait in Trawling Stations and for squirmies storage.
A super-food you prepare by drying packed wild potatoes under the sun in a cold, dry, environment like extreme hills. If the drying potatoes are exposed to moisture or left too long they will rot.
One of the stages or drops associated with the creation of Blessed Earth from Rainbow Slurry soaked mycelium. Rainbow Wisps will drop from Pinkly Mycelium blocks only. See wiki for instructions on farming.
Seasoned cudgel shards are dropped when a cudgel breaks after bludgeoning many hapless mobs. Use the shards to form the teeth of the pinkly Hack Sword for all your heady needs.
A safe capsule used to keep a bewitched non-hostile mob or captured villager's essence until re-animation is possible. +Use in a new location to generate a new, similar entity.
Items found only in or near a normal beanstalk, its loot boxes, or its junk chests. Read the wiki for the details of each item and go find yourself some Lost Beans!
An Obsidian Obliterator (found in a Beanstalk's crown loot) will often break off shards and flakes of obsidian as it works on an obsidian block. The block is not destroyed when flakes break off. A mini club hammer can also generate flakes but it takes a LONG time and the hammer will destroy the obsidian block in the process.
Special item found only in very rare loot chests or given as a reward for completing a particularly onerous challenge advancement.
Special item created by a corrupted Eye of Giants.
Albino Apples are dropped from the leaves of dark oak trees grown in forests or swamps. You MUST use a Whack a' Leaf Stick to harvest the dark oak leaves to get these apples.
The beginnings of one of Mr. G's Beanstalks. Lost Beans (from which saplings are grown) are found in stronghold library loot chests and rarely in a Nitwit villager's hidden inventory. Rainbow seeds planted on Blessed Earth occasionally produce a Stunted Beanstalk Sapling from which you can harvest a Lost Bean.
Use a Golden Name Tag to rename an unrepairable or X-enchanted item for the usual small Xp cost.
New tree drop from oak and birch trees. Use an axe to chop at these trees' leaves and occasionally a sturdy branch will drop. Fortune improves your drop chance.
One of several intermediate terraformed stage blocks generated by an activated primordial paleosol block. Many of the gravels are an abundant source of ore fragments.
One of several rotted or otherwise 'damaged' blocks produced when toxic Pig Slurry comes into contact with a particular kind of block. For example, Dirty Dirt results when slurry is allowed to permeate regular dirt blocks.
Special boots you create on a Mending Table using 4 pieces of Lift Twine and a pair of undamaged reinforced leather boots.
Custom mob head drops added by Pinkly Sheep. Typically you must use a hacking sword of some type to get these drops. Use mob heads as trophies or flatten them to use as activators for special weapons.
Charred remains of mobs killed with a Grim Reaper sword. Use as furnace fuel or to craft torches.
First-aid items you need to counteract negative effects like poison, venom, bleeding, infection, etc. Antitoxins and Antibiotics require Resistance III and Instant Health II potions as ingredients.
Special weapon created by beanstalk blacksmiths exclusively in response to a reforge request. Rarely you'll find discarded swords in overworld loot chests and some villager pouches.
