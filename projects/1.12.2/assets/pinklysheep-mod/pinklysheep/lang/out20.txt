Tato Go BOOM!
Create all four types of TnTatoes -- and use them! BOOOM! BOOOM!
Taste the Rainbow
Plant an Albino Melon, eat yourself a Rainbow Slice. You'll love the way you feel. We guarantee it.
The Pink and The Furious
Pinkly Eggs are dual-purpose: good for you, bad for mobs. Pop a few pinkly eggs into a brewing stand. Drink up. Tip up. Channel the pinkly rage!
Into The Sling of Things
Craft yourself a Squishies Slingshot and matching Ammo Pouch. Such a fashionable combination!
Walk on the Wild Side
Obtain a Wild Potato plantling, make an elevated potato farm, and harvest some tubers!
Walking on Air
Whip-up some Altitude Dust, craft yourself a stock of Lift Twine, and make yourself a pair of special Flight-not-Fight boots on a custom Mending Table. Time for take off!
Waste Not, Want Not
Learn to repurpose and recycle your greens and browns. Make drying piles for leaves. Transform your waste into green waste for composting.
Squirmed My Way In
Farming animals is easy; farming squirmies, now that's a tough job! Harvest lots of Manure. Get yourself some Eaticus Larvae. Make lots of Green Waste. Get yourself some Earthworms. Build a fancy deluxe Squirmies Farm Box. Fill it with food; add those critters; let nature take its course! Don't forget to remove the build-up of 'gunk'.
Wuss Mode
Protect yourself, your pets, and your beloved pinkly stuff with a Mob-Zapper 2000!
Hello, I am dropped animal poop. Do not be alarmed for I am the GOOD stuff. You are advised to collect as much of me as possible for use in your crop farming.
One of the new non-poo animal drops added by Pinkly Sheep. Pink sheep occasionally drop Pinkly Eggs and parrots will drop feathers. To get parrot eggs, you need one 'Papabird' and at least two 'Mamabird's.
One of the new ores or ore block drops added by Pinkly Sheep. You should find these ores in terrain and loot chests generated after the mod was installed.
