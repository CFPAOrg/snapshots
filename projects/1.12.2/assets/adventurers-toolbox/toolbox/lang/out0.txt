Toolmaking
The art of toolmaking is highly practicle, and quite simple.|All tools can be made from just a few types of tool parts. There are tool heads, which take many forms, and are specialized for use in a specific tool type. The head of the tool tends to define the tool's basic stats that other parts can then modify. There are also hafts and handles, which can be used to make a variety of different tools, and tend not to have too much of an effect on tool stats. Finally, there are adornments, which are always optional, but can provide noticable benefits to a tool's stats if you decide to add one.|To craft a tool out of the it's requisite parts, simply place all of the parts into a crafting table in any configuration.
