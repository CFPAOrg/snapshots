Have some stairs.
Uhh, have some slabs too.
It's just walls. How do I write a tagline for this?
Sanvocalia
Talk to Corporea Indexes
The &1Sanvocalia&0 is a flower especially attuned to corporetic frequencies. When this flower has &1Mana&0 available and is near a &1Corporea Index&0, it will whisper the requests written on nearby &1Corporea Tickets&0 to the &1Index&0.<br>Tickets can be created with a &1Corporea Solidifier&0 or a &1Ticker Conjurer&0.
Do you still remember?
Red String Liar
Lie to your network
Turns out, there was more to &4Red String&0 after all. The &1Red String Liar&0 works best when attached to a &4Corporea Network&0. It will bind to any block with an inventory, and will present the items in that inventory to the &4Corporea Network&0 as if it was an inventory full of whatever is in any adjacent &1Item Frames&0.
Extracting items from the linked inventory works normally. Since the &4Corporea Network&0 believes the inventory to be full of whatever is in the item frames, what is requested may not match what is received. This does not duplicate items.<br>Note that the &1Red String Liar&0 should have the &1Corporea Spark&0 attached, instead of the linked inventory.

Skytouching
What's the sky say?
Legend has it that blah blah &8blah blah&0 &7blah blah.&0<br>If you throw certain stuff above the height limit, it'll craft into other stuff. The higher it goes above the height limit, the more bonus output you'll get. This is called &4Skytouching&0. Try it with your &1Lexica Botania&0. Flavor text is hard and I'm tired.
GOLDEN RULE &8(hold shift over these!)&0
Cygnus Basics
How's all this stuff work?
The &4Cygnus Network&0 is a method of storing and manipulating abstract pieces of information in the world, known as &4Cygnus data&0. It works using a &4stack&0 data structure - various &4Cygnus-aligned blocks and items&0 can push data onto the stack, pop data off of it, make decisions based off of the top items, and so on.
