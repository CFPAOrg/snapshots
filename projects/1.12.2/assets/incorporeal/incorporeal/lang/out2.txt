They also say providing the flower with a high-powered &4Redstone Signal&0 will restart the tune while a low-powered signal will merely pause it, and that the &1Sweet Alexum Petite&0 needs the &1Note Blocks&0 to be placed closer but plays the song at a faster clip.<br>I wonder if these legends have any truth to them?
This is so sad.
Rod of the Fractured Space
Send items from anywhere to an Open Crate
The &1Rod of the Fractured Space&0 has the unique ability to, albeit briefly, open a small wormhole between two points in space. Only &1Items&0 seem to be small and light enough to fit.<br>Right click on an &1Open Crate&0 to set the destination location.
Then, any time you right click on the ground, all &1Items&0 nearby will be sucked in to the wormhole and dropped out of the &1Open Crate&0, no matter where they are. The process consumes more &1Mana&0 when more items are sent at once; perhaps packaging them up into something like a &1Shulker Box&0 first would be beneficial?
Ease, don't teleport
Ticket Conjurer
Create corporea tickets on the go
The &1Ticket Conjurer&0 assists in the creation of arbitrary &1Corporea Tickets&0, for use with the &1Sanvocalia&0 flower. Other than the fact that it's an item, not a block, it acts identically to a &1Corporea Index&0. Simply hold it in either hand, speak a &4Corporea Request&0, and a &1Corporea Ticket&0 will be created for it.
The only other difference between it and a &1Corporea Index&0 is in the behavior of the word "this", which will refer to the item in your off-hand when you hold the &1Ticket Conjurer&0 in your main hand, and vice versa.
Dying Breath of Stokesia
Corporea Inhibitor
Block corporea spark connections
The &1Corporea Inhibitor&0's peculiar composition seems to distort the corporetic field in a curious way. &1Corporea Sparks&0 are simply unable to form connections that pass through it.<br>They are pushable with &1Pistons&0.
