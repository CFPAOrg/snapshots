To inform a &1Soul Core&0 of your presence, right click it. The process of binding and unbinding a &4Soul&0 from a &1Core&0 has been known to sting a bit...<br>If a &1Soul Core&0 runs out of mana, it will lose the link to the &4Soul&0 it's bound to; right clicking again will re-establish it.
Driven Drop
The &1Ender Soul Core&0, at the cost of &4Mana&0, provides block-level access to the &1Ender Chest&0 inventory of the bound &4Player&0. As long as the &4Player&0 is present in the dimension, the &1Ender Soul Core&0's inventory will mirror the contents of their &1Ender Chest&0. All the usual interactions work; hoppers, corporea sparks...
You Would Not Believe This Random Hecking Nonsense
The &1Corporea Soul Core&0 is a simple privacy system for &4Corporea Networks&0. &4Players&0 are not able to use a &1Corporea Index&0 on the same network as a &1Corporea Soul Core&0, unless one of the &1Corporea Soul Core&0s on it contains their &4Soul&0.<br>It does not use &4Mana&0.
Now let me see you &2DANCE&0
The &1Blood Soul Core&0, at the cost of &4Mana&0, injects all potion effects received via &1Splash Potions&0 into the bloodstream of the bound &4Player&0.<br>Since the &4Soul&0 suspended in a &1Soul Core&0 is technically undead, this process will cause the usual effect inversions to occur (instant health will damage the bound &1Player&0, for example.)

Elven Decoration
Stairs, slabs, and stuff
Any &4Corporeticist&0 or &4Red Stringlayer&0 worth their salt keeps a tidy and well-decorated laboratory; what better to use than &1Corporea&0 and &1Red String&0 itself?<br>However, it'd certainly be nice to shave off the magical properties of blocks intended purely for decoration, to avoid oversaturation of the corporetic fields (and, well, server lag)
Corporea Tiles
Bricks, for throwing at you
