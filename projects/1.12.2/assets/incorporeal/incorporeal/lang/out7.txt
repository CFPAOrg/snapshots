The &3Integer&0 datatype represents a positive or negative whole number. Many &1Cygnus Words&0 are available to add, subtract, and multiply these numbers. The number can be up to 50 digits long (not counting the minus sign, if any) - actions which produce a number larger than that will instead produce an &3Invalid math operation&0 error.
The &3Corporea Request&0 datatype represents a request for items from a &4Corporea Network&0. It is a bundle of a &4matcher&0 (the name or identity of the item being requested) and a numeric count. The &3Corporea Request&0 datatype is able to express "identity" style requests from &1Corporea Funnels&0, as well as "by name" requests from &1Corporea Indices&0.
The &3Error&0 datatype represents some computation error. Generally, these are pushed instead of the result of a computation when the action was not successful. Trying to add two non-numbers pushes a &3Type mismatch&0, trying to duplicate the top item of an empty &4stack&0 pushes a &3Stack underflow&0, dividing by zero pushes an &3Invalid math operation&0, and so on.
The &3Cygnus Stack&0 datatype represents another Cygnus &4stack&0, packaged as a single item. These can be packaged and unpackaged by &4sourcing&0 from or &4sinking&0 into a &1Cygnus Master Spark&0 with a &1Cygnus Funnel&0.
Cygnus Sparks
Data on the stack
Placing a &1Master Cygnus Spark&0 defines the center of a &4Cygnus network&0. It is home to a &4Cygnus Stack&0: a collection of up to sixteen units of &4Cygnus data&0. &1Master Cygnus Sparks&0 can be placed anywhere, and the contents of the &4stack&0 will display above it. Wearing a &1Manaseer Monocle&0 will cause the stack's contents to show through walls!
Regular &1Cygnus Sparks&0, when placed within eight blocks of a &1Master Cygnus Spark&0, will connect to it. &1Cygnus Sparks&0 also link to other &1Cygnus Sparks&0; much like a &4Corporea Network&0, you can extend the reach of a &4Cygnus Network&0 endlessly. All &1Cygnus Sparks&0 on the same &4Cygnus Network&0 provide access to the same &4Cygnus Stack&0.
