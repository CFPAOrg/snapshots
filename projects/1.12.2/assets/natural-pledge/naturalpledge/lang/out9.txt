Priestly Fashion - Loki
Sneaking past your defenses
No priest would be caught dead without a ceremonial robe, although robes aren't actually required to pay allegiance to a divinity.<br>These robes, beyond being fashionable, provide a tangible benefit. Loki's robes make their wearer unable to trip any of his traps, allowing them safe passage. Loki's typical tricks, like fire and explosives, also won't touch the wearer.
Made with quality dwarven rocks
Trap Sigils
Invisible tricks
Traps, made from Loki's flame, can be used to trick and deceive your enemies. Each one has a special effect. Some of them last forever, and others disappear on use. Those which disappear return sixteen when crafting.
The first trap allows you to spin around anyone who walks in it, 90Â° to the side. This one lasts forever, allowing it to be a permanent fixture of a base.
How can we see if our eyes aren't real
The second trap allows you to create a ring of flame when it's tripped. This one only lasts for one use, so use it wisely.
Alchemy circles
The third trap allows you to launch anyone who trips it. This can be used offensively or as a fixture of a base, as it lasts forever.
Wheeeeeeeeeeee
The fourth trap, which &3Loki&0 reminds you has no connection to the offices of &3Elucent&0, roots down anyone who trips it. As it only lasts once, be prepared to take advantage of it immediately.
Our rooted predates his
The fifth trap blinds and slows anyone who trips it, throwing sand into their vision to accomplish this. It only works once, so strike quickly.
