Faith in Heimdall
Fate, travel, and color
The &4Æsir&0 god of the Bifrost, &3Heimdall&0, seems like an interesting god to channel. Wielding his aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your eyes see more vibrantly, seeing light even in the shadow (except when your eyes almost can't see color at all through &4Drab Vision&0). When carrying a &1Rod of the Bifrost&0, you leave a trail of rainbow &4Bifrost&0 below you, allowing you to run in the sky.
The warder of heaven
Bifrost Magic
The art of Iridescence
The first spell that &3Heimdall&0's emblem grants, &1Iridescent Tones&0, creates a resonating sound that vibrates with the essence of color. Casting it on any dye will crystallize it, converting it into &1Iridescent Crystal&0. This crystal acts as a higher-potency dye, able to colorize even things like dirt.
The second spell of &3Heimdall&0, &1Wave of Bifrost&0, creates for you a safe haven. When you cast it, a sphere of &4Bifrost&0 will rise around you, stopping your fall and giving you temporary protection from anything around you.
Priestly Fashion - Heimdall
A different way to move
No priest would be caught dead without a ceremonial robe, although robes aren't actually required to pay allegiance to a divinity.<br>These robes, beyond being fashionable, provide a tangible benefit. Heimdall's robes make their wearer blink towards their vision whenever they jump while sprinting, giving them a different type of motion.
Ever get that feeling of déjà vu?
Faith in Loki
Tricks, traps, and fire
The &4Jötun&0 god of flame, &3Loki&0, seems like a &owonderful&0 god to channel. Wielding his aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body resistant to fire, absorbing it into your body. When holding a &1Fire Charge&0, you can fling it like a ghast's breath.
He was fortunate in his deceit
Ephemeral Magic
The art of trickery
The first spell that &3Loki&0's emblem grants, &1Fire Cycle&0, &4Progresses&0 the life of coal, turning it into embers. The legal department of &3Loki&0 would like to remind &3Elucent&0 that this does not constitute a break of license.
