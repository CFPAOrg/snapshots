By wearing your &1Priestly Emblem&0, the Guardian ought to offer a fiercer challenge. The &3Divine&0 power this will channel into the Guardian will give it power and health as the ritual plays out. The moment you slay the &4Guardian&0, that focused energy will leap into your &1Priestly Emblem&0. The power you could gain from this connection is staggering.
Consequences of Power
Hindsight is 20/20
The power you gained from the &3Divine Guardian&0 ritual was grand, but it has drawbacks. For one, you can't take off the imbued emblem. For another, someone wielding a &4Mortalstone&0 could kill you easily, due to the disconnect between the &3Divine&0 and Mortality being so jarring. Holding one allows severing the connection, by tearing the emblem off, but the process is rather lethal.
Apples of Immortality
Exactly what it says on the can
Now that you are fully connected to &3Idunn&0, you can begin to receive her divine gifts. The primary form of these gifts are apples of gold, which make the eater nearly immortal. They'll be resistant to most forms of damage.
Happiness literally grows on trees
A simple brew, it mimics the &1Apple of Immortality&0. When taken, it has a similar effect, giving the individual a &4Immortality&0 effect.
Gather the dragonballs, I need to make a wish
Mjolnir the Crusher
A hammer that throws you forward
Now that you are fully connected to &3Thor&0, you can begin to receive his divine gifts. These gifts come in the form of the &1Crusher&0, &1Mjolnir&0. This hammer is so unnaturally balanced that swinging it will fling you forward, increasing your knockback when you're attacking and providing a convenient escape strategy.
It's not a boomerang
The Horn of Fate
A horn that gives mobs existential crises
Now that you are fully connected to &3Heimdall&0, you can begin to receive his divine gifts. These gifts come in the form of the &1Horn of Fate&0, &1Gjallerhorn&0. This horn's sound reveals a mob's fate to it, making it barely able to move while it comprehends what it has seen.
