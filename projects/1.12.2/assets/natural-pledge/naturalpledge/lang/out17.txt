Not a tessaract
Stone of Meditation
Sleep far away from a base
When travelling far away from home, it can often be hard to sleep to accelerate the night. If you use a &1Stone of Meditation&0, it allows you to simulate sleep from far away from a base. Hold it and you'll begin to meditate, simulating sleep in a &1Bed&0.
Peer into the Spirit
Stone of Nether Fracture
Point to your last portal
The &1Stone of Nether Fracture&0 acts like a &1Traveller's Waystone&0, except it points directly to the last &4Nether Portal&0 you stepped through. Like the &1Stone of Return&0, shift-clicking in the air will clear its destination.
Keralian resonance
Stone of Assimilation
Break things your tools won't normally
If a regular &4Manasteel Tool&0 won't do the job, the &1Stone of Assimilation&0 just might. Anything a regular tool can't break quickly, like &1Glass&0 or &1Leaves&0, the Stone of Assimilation can. It works with the &1Ring of Correction&0. It can also be enchanted just like a regular manasteel tool.
I am all stones on this blessed day
Contract Breaker
Spin the black circle
Spin the crackling circle from the waking &1Ã¦ther&0 of &3Heimdall&0, yellow as the blood of gods. Spin it through the waking &1seas&0 of &3Njord&0, blue as the deepest oceans. Spin it under the waking &1skies&0 of &3Thor&0, green as the grass of plains. Spin it with the waking &1flames&0 of &3Loki&0, red as the blood from which they're born. Spin it to the waking &1land&0 of &3Idunn&0, brown as the deepest dirt, and back to your beginning.
Offer their souls, and burn forth a token, and may ye see the &3end&0.
Faith in Ragnarok
The power of the end
The &1twisted pendant&0 seems like a dangerous option for faith. The &3apocalypse&0 is not to be tested lightly. Something about it resonates with the other gods, as if it is tied to their fates. The gifts of every god are conferred through the twisted pendant. As for spells, not all of the spells carried through, leaving you with only one from each god.
