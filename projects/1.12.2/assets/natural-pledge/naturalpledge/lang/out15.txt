Don't let the existential dread set in
Arrows of Ascension
Arrows which remove weight
Now that you are fully connected to &3Njord&0, you can begin to receive his divine gifts. These gifts come in the form of the &1Arrows of Ascension&0. These arrows remove the hit player's weight temporarily, causing the tiny fluctuations of the wind to push them up. While the arrow itself is not lethal, the resulting fall might be to the unprepared.

Fist of Perdition
A charging fireball
Now that you are fully connected to &3Loki&0, you can begin to receive his divine gifts. These gifts come in the form of the &1Fist of Perdition&0. This fist grows more powerful the longer its use is charged, releasing a &1Fire Charge&0 from your inventory at the end with all the force of the charge behind it.

Iridescent Sapling
A really big carnation
The &1Iridescent Sapling&0 has no true color of its own. Instead, it grows with whatever dirt is beneath it as a color. Not all dirt can be used in this way, including natural dirt. A good starting point is the special &1Pasture Seeds&0.
Deconstruction but no reconstruction
Livingwood Funnel
A single-slot hopper
For some people, the &1Hopper&0 is too lax. It allows items through when it shouldn't, and sometimes moves them too fast. The &1Livingwood Funnel&0 is far, far stricter. It only allows one item through at a time, and can be filtered by placing an &1Item Frame&0 on one of its sides. Its contents can be seen by looking at it while holding a &1Wand of the Forest&0.

Sonic Amplifier
Louder sounds
By dampening the sounds of the air within &1Note Blocks&0, the &1Sonic Amplifier&0 can reverberate sound, making sounds within a block or two sound far louder. The more you have, the louder the sound.
