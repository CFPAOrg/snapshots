Kneel before the gods
Traces of divine work are evident in this world. &4Mana&0, for one. The stuff of magic isn't possibly made by mortal hand. It is only a question of how to connect with these gods.
The &1Holy Symbol&0 is the needed artifact for this connection, with what seems to be a wild storm of unrealized potential. Although crafted of simple materials, it has a ready acceptance of other magic. This is the gate to the &3Divine&0, and can be used to forge direct connections in the form of a &1Priestly Emblem&0. Wearing one will grant you more knowledge in this section.
A key to the zodiac
The connection the &1Priestly Emblems&0 give you are strong, but don't contain the full power you can harness. An interface to channel the power of a god on earth is required, to allow you to fully command the power you have gained. This interface is the &1Terrestrial Focus&0, a device which can cast &3Divine&0 spells.
Taking a level in Cleric
Even then, some may not wish to bind themselves to a god, but instead to fight them. By oversaturating the connection between a priest and their follower with &4Mana&0, you can fully cut it off. This can be accomplished by holding a &1Mortalstone&0, which forces &4Mana&0 into the soul of anyone around you.
The Kaj's weapon
Faith in Njord
Wind, sea, and sky
The &4Vanir&0 god of the fluid elements, &3Njord&0, seems like a worthy choice for your faith. Wielding his aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body hydrophobic, rising above any kind of fluid. You also gain attacks with the force of the wind, barreling your foes back with your every hit.
At the doom of men he will come back
Movement Magic
The art of changing flows
The first spell that &3Njord&0's emblem grants, &1Rush of Wind&0, is a simple launching motion. It accelerates the caster in the direction they look, allowing for rudimentary flight. Any device that allows the user to glide seems an interesting combination with this.
The second spell of &3Njord&0, &1Galeforce&0, is a general protection spell. Most beings and projectiles will be pushed back from the player, giving them a sphere of safety.
The third spell of &3Njord&0, &1Sudden Gust&0, allows for corralling animals without harming them. The being the player looks at will be forced back when it's cast, as if the player had hit them.
The final spell of &3Njord&0, &1Tempest Infusion&0, forces the strength of a storm into a shard of the sea, making &1Aquamarine&0. If you can somehow augment your emblem's power, the storm within the shard might be more potent.
It's so pretty

Priestly Fashion - Njord
Feather Fall
No priest would be caught dead without a ceremonial robe, although robes aren't actually required to pay allegiance to a divinity.<br>These robes, beyond being fashionable, provide a tangible benefit. Njord's robes allow the user to float softly to the ground while falling.
Worked for Belkar
Faith in Idunn
Life, spring, and immortality
The &4Vanir&0 god of the living elements, &3Idunn&0, seems like a good choice to declare yourself for. Wielding her aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body naturally catalytic to the growth of trees, giving saplings around you an effect similar to &1Bonemeal&0. You can manually apply this affect by sneak-clicking with an empty hand.
Ash sunk down of alfen race
Life Magic
The art of growth
The first spell that &3Idunn&0's emblem grants, &1Shield of Roots&0, is a powerful protection spell. While you have the &1Terrestrial Focus&0, for half a minute you will be unable to move, take, or deal melee damage. Giving the &1Focus&0 to someone else in that time will treat them as if they had been the one to cast the spell.
The second and final spell of &3Idunn&0, &1Life Catalyst&0, forces power into livingwood, twisting it to become &1Soulroot&0. If you can somehow augment your emblem's power, the root's lifeforce might be more potent.
Priestly Fashion - Idunn
Head on or backstab
No priest would be caught dead without a ceremonial robe, although robes aren't actually required to pay allegiance to a divinity.<br>These robes, beyond being fashionable, provide a tangible benefit. Idunn's robes protect their wearer from attacks to the side, making all viable combat head on.
Bring it on! I &olive&0 for this!
Faith in Thor
Thunder, strength, and wrath
The &4Æsir&0 god of the sky, &3Thor&0, seems like a powerful god to ally with. Wielding his aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body makes your body swift, similar to the &1Soujourner's Sash&0. When using axes, the closest thing you could find to a hammer, &3Thor&0 will add force to your hit, slowing down whatever poor mob is stricken.
In anger smite the earth
Battle Magic
The art of war
The first spell that &3Thor&0's emblem grants, &1Lightning Strike&0, is a very simple lightning spell. Electricity will arc out of the caster, striking whatever they're looking at within 10 blocks. This won't do much unless you hit a mob, of course.
The second spell of &3Thor&0, &1Thunder's Force&0, is a strength spell. While you have the &1Terrestrial Focus&0, for half a minute you will hit with over twice the force you'd normally wield. Giving the &1Focus&0 to someone else in that time will treat them as if they had been the one to cast the spell.
The third spell of &3Thor&0, &1Chains of Iron&0, almost seems to intrude upon the domain of &4Movement magic&0. It pulls the mob you look at towards you, as if you were a magnet and it iron. The pulled mob becomes slow for ten seconds, making their escape much harder.
The fourth spell of &3Thor&0, &1Hypercharge&0, forces electric energy into the air where it hits, creating a pocket of electric charge. Anyone foolish enough to walk into it will be
The final spell of &3Thor&0, &1Thunder Infusion&0, forces power into regular iron, making &1Thundersteel&0. If you can somehow augment your emblem's power, the metal might be more potent.

Priestly Fashion - Thor
Smashy smashy
No priest would be caught dead without a ceremonial robe, although robes aren't actually required to pay allegiance to a divinity.<br>These robes, beyond being fashionable, provide a tangible benefit. Thor's robes shield their wearer from the brunt of fall damage, instead spreading it to anything around.
Superhero landing!
Faith in Heimdall
Fate, travel, and color
The &4Æsir&0 god of the Bifrost, &3Heimdall&0, seems like an interesting god to channel. Wielding his aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your eyes see more vibrantly, seeing light even in the shadow (except when your eyes almost can't see color at all through &4Drab Vision&0). When carrying a &1Rod of the Bifrost&0, you leave a trail of rainbow &4Bifrost&0 below you, allowing you to run in the sky.
The warder of heaven
Bifrost Magic
The art of Iridescence
The first spell that &3Heimdall&0's emblem grants, &1Iridescent Tones&0, creates a resonating sound that vibrates with the essence of color. Casting it on any dye will crystallize it, converting it into &1Iridescent Crystal&0. This crystal acts as a higher-potency dye, able to colorize even things like dirt.
The second spell of &3Heimdall&0, &1Wave of Bifrost&0, creates for you a safe haven. When you cast it, a sphere of &4Bifrost&0 will rise around you, stopping your fall and giving you temporary protection from anything around you.
Priestly Fashion - Heimdall
A different way to move
No priest would be caught dead without a ceremonial robe, although robes aren't actually required to pay allegiance to a divinity.<br>These robes, beyond being fashionable, provide a tangible benefit. Heimdall's robes make their wearer blink towards their vision whenever they jump while sprinting, giving them a different type of motion.
Ever get that feeling of déjà vu?
Faith in Loki
Tricks, traps, and fire
The &4Jötun&0 god of flame, &3Loki&0, seems like a &owonderful&0 god to channel. Wielding his aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body resistant to fire, absorbing it into your body. When holding a &1Fire Charge&0, you can fling it like a ghast's breath.
He was fortunate in his deceit
Ephemeral Magic
The art of trickery
The first spell that &3Loki&0's emblem grants, &1Fire Cycle&0, &4Progresses&0 the life of coal, turning it into embers. The legal department of &3Loki&0 would like to remind &3Elucent&0 that this does not constitute a break of license.
The second spell of &3Loki&0, &1Truesight&0, opens your eyes to the traps his followers can set. Each trap will be highlighted with a different form of red wisps.
The third spell of &3Loki&0, &1Aura of Disdain&0, creates an aura of flames. Anything within it will be Everburned for five seconds after they leave the aura.
The fourth and final spell of &3Loki&0, &1Inferno Jet&0, creates a jet of flames which attacks the focused target.
Priestly Fashion - Loki
Sneaking past your defenses
No priest would be caught dead without a ceremonial robe, although robes aren't actually required to pay allegiance to a divinity.<br>These robes, beyond being fashionable, provide a tangible benefit. Loki's robes make their wearer unable to trip any of his traps, allowing them safe passage. Loki's typical tricks, like fire and explosives, also won't touch the wearer.
Made with quality dwarven rocks
Trap Sigils
Invisible tricks
Traps, made from Loki's flame, can be used to trick and deceive your enemies. Each one has a special effect. Some of them last forever, and others disappear on use. Those which disappear return sixteen when crafting.
The first trap allows you to spin around anyone who walks in it, 90° to the side. This one lasts forever, allowing it to be a permanent fixture of a base.
How can we see if our eyes aren't real
The second trap allows you to create a ring of flame when it's tripped. This one only lasts for one use, so use it wisely.
Alchemy circles
The third trap allows you to launch anyone who trips it. This can be used offensively or as a fixture of a base, as it lasts forever.
Wheeeeeeeeeeee
The fourth trap, which &3Loki&0 reminds you has no connection to the offices of &3Elucent&0, roots down anyone who trips it. As it only lasts once, be prepared to take advantage of it immediately.
Our rooted predates his
The fifth trap blinds and slows anyone who trips it, throwing sand into their vision to accomplish this. It only works once, so strike quickly.
Pocket sand!
The sixth trap is just a pressure plate, but one that doesn't need to be on a block, and can emit strong redstone pulses. It'll work forever, and can even be used to replace a pressure plate in regular bases.
Red stone
The seventh and final trap, the Wrath trap, brings Loki's ire upon anyone who steps in it, highlighting them and giving them their Deity's Disfavor.
He's always angry
Brew of Monochromacy
Negating color
An interesting brew, it saps color out of the sight of the person who drinks it. It is most useful when in incense form.
Instant colorblindness
Traveller's Toolbelt
Storage on the go
&3Heimdall&0, being a god of travellers, provides tools to his devotees to make travels easier. One of these useful tools is the &1Traveller's Toolbelt&0. Instead of rushing from place to place like some botanist's belts do, this toolbelt holds items, allowing you to prepare for any eventuality. After all, it's nice to just take some time to appreciate the wonders of the world in your travels.
Journey before destination
Traveller's Ration Belt
A second mouth
&3Heimdall&0, being a god of travellers, provides tools to his devotees to make travels easier. One of these useful tools is the &1Traveller's Ration Belt&0. Instead of rushing from place to place like some botanist's belts do, this toolbelt will automatically sate your stomach from food in your hotbar, allowing you to focus more on the journey.
Strength before weakness
Traveller's Flowstone
A component sash
&3Heimdall&0, being a god of travellers, provides tools to his devotees to make travels easier. One of these useful tools is the &1Traveller's Flowstone&0. As a traveller may use belts other than the &1Sashes&0, it gives you the little quirks that make those belts so useful without sacrificing leisure. Specifically, it makes you jump higher and scale small walls. However, it only makes you jump higher while sneaking.
Life before death
Traveller's Waystone
GPS
&3Heimdall&0, being a god of travellers, provides tools to his devotees to make travels easier. One of these useful tools is the &1Traveller's Waystone&0. It can be bound to a point or named &otrack:&0 and a player's name to track that player, and will give you an indication of what direction to go as long as you're holding it, allowing for easy travels home or to a friend.
Remember those who have been forgotten
By combining the stone with the essence of death, you can make a version which targets past lives instead of the present. When you die, you'll reincarnate holding any &1Stones of Return&0 you had on you. These will point your way to the place you died. If you shift-click the stone in the air, it will clear its destination.
Listen to those who have been ignored
Frozen Stars
An ender light source
The &1Frozen Star&0 is the light and form of the stars, trapped upon earth, and given form through &4Iridescence&0. They are relatively cheap light sources, and give off light with the same strength as &1Glowstone&0. They can be made in any of the colors of &4Iridescence&0.
Find Polaris to find your way
Iridescent Shards
Mana-powered dye
The &1Iridescent Shard&0 is a refined form of the crystals produced by the &1Iridescent Tones&0. It can output its dye for as long as it has mana, and can be recharged in a pool.
Double rainbows
Rod of the Prismatic Lake
Rainbow lights
One particularly frustrating property of the &1Mana Lens: Flash&0 is its tendency to lock the color of a &1Mana Flash&0 immediately upon making it. Even if you want to make a rainbow &1Flash&0, you'll get one color. By using the power of the &1Rod of the Prismatic Lake&0, you can make that rainbow. It can be tinged with &1Phantom Ink&0, and dyed with any &4Iridescent&0 dye like leather armor.
All the colors of the wind
Iridescent Dirt
Dirt in lots of colors
Using the power of &4Iridescence&0, you can make dirt that shimmers every color of the rainbow. This mystical dirt is capable of growing trees and plants without water or a hoe. It can be converted back to regular dirt using a &1Pure Daisy&0.
Beauty from the dross
Using the &1Iridescent Sapling&0, you can create a variety of tree that grows in all the colors of &1Iridescent Dirt&0. This can be achieved simply by planting the sapling on any colored dirt and letting it grow.
2x4s
Aurora Dirt
One dirt, lots of colors
By combining dirt with the shimmering essence of a &1Mana Pearl&0, you can make dirt that captures the threads of magic in the world, having a different color based on its location. This mystical dirt is also capable of growing trees and plants without water or a hoe. It can be converted back to regular dirt using a &1Pure Daisy&0.
Seek the hour of twilight in the forest of silence
Break it down
Iridescent Lantern
A power-level indicating light
The &1Iridescent Lantern&0 glows with all the colors of the rainbow. While black in appearance when first set down, giving it a redstone signal will change its color. The higher the signal, the farther down the rainbow the color becomes.<br>If given a full-strength signal, the &1Iridescent Lantern&0 will glow throughout the vibrant rainbow.
Disco ball
Fists of Thunder
A weapon that gets better in pairs
The &1Fists of Thunder&0 are the standard weapons of any priest of &3Thor&0. One is formidable enough, acting like a quicker &1Iron Sword&0. If you have one on each hand, though, you can block with them as if they were a shield. They can be enchanted to make them heavier or lighter, changing their properties.
Stopping power
Sealing Oak
Sound muffling tree
The &1Sealing Oak&0 dampens the effects of loud sounds around it, causing anything around it to sound strangely far away. With enough, it's nearly impossible to hear. Any of the blocks in one of these trees can seal sounds.
An extra utility
The planks work too
Thunderous Oak
A lightning rod
The &1Thunderous Oak&0 absorbs lightning that strikes around it, preventing it from harming or transforming anything at all. Any of the blocks in one of these trees can absorb lightning.
Thor'll hate you
The planks work too
Circuitree
A redstone emitter
The &1Circuitree&0 emits a redstone signal of a strength equal to the number of &1Circuitree&0 blocks consecutively above it. Any block from the tree can be used in the stack, including the sapling.
I deeply apologize for the pun
The planks work too
Calico Tree
An explosion absorber
The &1Calico Tree&0 is so cat-like, it scares more than just creepers away, it actually scares off any explosion at all. Any block from the tree can be used for this, including the sapling.
Not a scratching post
The planks work too
The Ritual of Gaia III
Sight, Sound, Strength, Power, Glory, Speed!
The ritual performed to face off against the soul of the Earth is a incredible challenge, which allows one to obtain &5Relics&0 and &1Gaia Spirits&0. As you fight, this ritual connects you to the &3Divine&0 by your struggles. So, maybe you could... invert that connection. Through that, you would force a fragment of the &3Divine&0 into your &1Priestly Emblem&0.
By using &1Divine Ritual Cores&0, you can modify the &4Ritual of Gaia&0 to do just that. These devices focus the energy of the &3Divine&0 into the Guardian, giving it power and health as the ritual plays out. The moment you slay the &4Guardian&0, that focused energy will leap into your &1Priestly Emblem&0. The power you could gain from this connection is staggering.
The Ritual of Gaia III
Seek the center to change the world
The ritual performed to face off against the soul of the Earth is a incredible challenge, which allows one to obtain &5Relics&0 and &1Gaia Spirits&0. As you fight, this ritual connects you to the &3Divine&0 by your struggles. So, maybe you could... invert that connection. Through that, you would force a fragment of the &3Divine&0 into your &1Priestly Emblem&0.
By wearing your &1Priestly Emblem&0, the Guardian ought to offer a fiercer challenge. The &3Divine&0 power this will channel into the Guardian will give it power and health as the ritual plays out. The moment you slay the &4Guardian&0, that focused energy will leap into your &1Priestly Emblem&0. The power you could gain from this connection is staggering.
Consequences of Power
Hindsight is 20/20
The power you gained from the &3Divine Guardian&0 ritual was grand, but it has drawbacks. For one, you can't take off the imbued emblem. For another, someone wielding a &4Mortalstone&0 could kill you easily, due to the disconnect between the &3Divine&0 and Mortality being so jarring. Holding one allows severing the connection, by tearing the emblem off, but the process is rather lethal.
Apples of Immortality
Exactly what it says on the can
Now that you are fully connected to &3Idunn&0, you can begin to receive her divine gifts. The primary form of these gifts are apples of gold, which make the eater nearly immortal. They'll be resistant to most forms of damage.
Happiness literally grows on trees
A simple brew, it mimics the &1Apple of Immortality&0. When taken, it has a similar effect, giving the individual a &4Immortality&0 effect.
Gather the dragonballs, I need to make a wish
Mjolnir the Crusher
A hammer that throws you forward
Now that you are fully connected to &3Thor&0, you can begin to receive his divine gifts. These gifts come in the form of the &1Crusher&0, &1Mjolnir&0. This hammer is so unnaturally balanced that swinging it will fling you forward, increasing your knockback when you're attacking and providing a convenient escape strategy.
It's not a boomerang
The Horn of Fate
A horn that gives mobs existential crises
Now that you are fully connected to &3Heimdall&0, you can begin to receive his divine gifts. These gifts come in the form of the &1Horn of Fate&0, &1Gjallerhorn&0. This horn's sound reveals a mob's fate to it, making it barely able to move while it comprehends what it has seen.
Don't let the existential dread set in
Arrows of Ascension
Arrows which remove weight
Now that you are fully connected to &3Njord&0, you can begin to receive his divine gifts. These gifts come in the form of the &1Arrows of Ascension&0. These arrows remove the hit player's weight temporarily, causing the tiny fluctuations of the wind to push them up. While the arrow itself is not lethal, the resulting fall might be to the unprepared.

Fist of Perdition
A charging fireball
Now that you are fully connected to &3Loki&0, you can begin to receive his divine gifts. These gifts come in the form of the &1Fist of Perdition&0. This fist grows more powerful the longer its use is charged, releasing a &1Fire Charge&0 from your inventory at the end with all the force of the charge behind it.
Takes three episodes to fire
Iridescent Sapling
A really big carnation
The &1Iridescent Sapling&0 has no true color of its own. Instead, it grows with whatever dirt is beneath it as a color. Not all dirt can be used in this way, including natural dirt. A good starting point is the special &1Pasture Seeds&0.
Deconstruction but no reconstruction
Livingwood Funnel
A single-slot hopper
For some people, the &1Hopper&0 is too lax. It allows items through when it shouldn't, and sometimes moves them too fast. The &1Livingwood Funnel&0 is far, far stricter. It only allows one item through at a time, and can be filtered by placing an &1Item Frame&0 on one of its sides. Its contents can be seen by looking at it while holding a &1Wand of the Forest&0.

Sonic Amplifier
Louder sounds
By dampening the sounds of the air within &1Note Blocks&0, the &1Sonic Amplifier&0 can reverberate sound, making sounds within a block or two sound far louder. The more you have, the louder the sound.
Don't whisper
Crackling Stars
An unstable light source
The &1Crackling Star&0 is the form of the stars, trapped upon earth, and brought forth through &4Iridescence&0. They appear as a ball of light, but will distribute their mass to a &1Crackling Star&0 it's bound to with a &1Wand of the Forest&0. They give off light with the same strength as &1Glowstone&0, and can be made in any of the colors of &4Iridescence&0.
Wire's frames
Weighted Belt
Prevents floating
While waterwalking is nice, sometimes a priest of &3Njord&0 needs to walk on the bottom of the ocean. While sneaking can work, it's sometimes nicer to just sink. The &1Weighted Belt&0 will drag you down in air, and prevent waterwalking.
Fancier cement shoes
Tome of the Ages
Break down enchantments
Enchantments rarely go exactly as planned, and using &1Spellbinding Cloth&0 doesn't give anything back. The &1Tome of the Ages&0 transfers one enchantment at a time into the ancient collective knowledge of the forests, and releases the experience of the enchantment, which can be retrieved with a simple use of the book. Sneak-using the book will steal your experience, allowing you to store it, if imperfectly.
All hail the second Eaton
Remote Corporea
Request items from a Corporea network remotely
The &1Corporea Resonator&0 and its counterpart, the &1Stone of Recall&0, allow for accessing a corporea network from far away. If you bind a &1Stone&0 to a &1Resonator&0 as if it was a &1Waystone&0, holding the Stone will allow you to trigger the &1Resonator&0 as if it was a &1Corporea Index&0, dropping the results as if it was a &1Corporea Funnel&0.
Let's Go! Soul Resonance!
I can't remember...
Ender Actuator
Control your Ender Chest remotely
The &1Ender Actuator&0 is an interesting block, allowing resonance with your &4Ender Chest&0 from across the world. To activate one, click a disabled one and it will begin to shine. As long as you are in the same dimension as a bound &1Actuator&0, it will act as an interface for your &4Ender Chest&0 for machines to use.
Not a tessaract
Stone of Meditation
Sleep far away from a base
When travelling far away from home, it can often be hard to sleep to accelerate the night. If you use a &1Stone of Meditation&0, it allows you to simulate sleep from far away from a base. Hold it and you'll begin to meditate, simulating sleep in a &1Bed&0.
Peer into the Spirit
Stone of Nether Fracture
Point to your last portal
The &1Stone of Nether Fracture&0 acts like a &1Traveller's Waystone&0, except it points directly to the last &4Nether Portal&0 you stepped through. Like the &1Stone of Return&0, shift-clicking in the air will clear its destination.
Keralian resonance
Stone of Assimilation
Break things your tools won't normally
If a regular &4Manasteel Tool&0 won't do the job, the &1Stone of Assimilation&0 just might. Anything a regular tool can't break quickly, like &1Glass&0 or &1Leaves&0, the Stone of Assimilation can. It works with the &1Ring of Correction&0. It can also be enchanted just like a regular manasteel tool.
I am all stones on this blessed day
Contract Breaker
Spin the black circle
Spin the crackling circle from the waking &1æther&0 of &3Heimdall&0, yellow as the blood of gods. Spin it through the waking &1seas&0 of &3Njord&0, blue as the deepest oceans. Spin it under the waking &1skies&0 of &3Thor&0, green as the grass of plains. Spin it with the waking &1flames&0 of &3Loki&0, red as the blood from which they're born. Spin it to the waking &1land&0 of &3Idunn&0, brown as the deepest dirt, and back to your beginning.
Offer their souls, and burn forth a token, and may ye see the &3end&0.
Faith in Ragnarok
The power of the end
The &1twisted pendant&0 seems like a dangerous option for faith. The &3apocalypse&0 is not to be tested lightly. Something about it resonates with the other gods, as if it is tied to their fates. The gifts of every god are conferred through the twisted pendant. As for spells, not all of the spells carried through, leaving you with only one from each god.
There is a single spell unique to faith in &3Ragnarok&0, &4Soul Manifestation&0. While it acts like any other infusion spell, creating &4Iridescence&0, &1Aquamarine&0, &1Thundersteel&0, &1Soulroot&0, and &1Hearth Ember&0, it can also twist the essence of the divine contained within a &1Nether Star&0 into a far purer form: Divine Spirit.
Gear of Eclipse
Keep your enemies far and your friends farther
The gear created with the essence of &4Eclipse&0 encourages you to make your way alone. The &4Mana Masquerade&0, the special ability of the armor set, will recharge your mana from raw life energy, stealing the health of the soulless and the &4Mana&0 of players. The blade of &4Eclipse&0, &1Flarebringer&0, will swing farther than you can reach, cutting past your own limitations.

Gear of the Sunmaker
Unite them
The gear created with the essence of the &4Sunmaker&0 encourages you to be a bastion against a storm. The &4Unseen Light&0, the special ability of the armor set, will infuse mana into anything damaged you hold or in your body, repairing it and cleansing you. The blade of the &4Sunmaker&0, &1Oathbringer&0, will repulse enemies who dare try to attack from behind, and any attacks from far away, keeping your duels with Honor.

Gear of Fenris
Break thy bonds
The gear created with the essence of &4Fenris Wolf&0 encourages you to fight where others falter, surpassing your own limitations to cut &1Gleipnir&0. The &4Soul Unbound&0, the special ability of the armor set, strengthens you and strikes past armor when bare-handed. The claws of &4Fenris&0, &1Nightscourge&0, will also strike through armor, and can block attacks like a shield.
