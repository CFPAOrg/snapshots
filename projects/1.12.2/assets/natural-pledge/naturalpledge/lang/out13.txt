Circuitree
A redstone emitter
The &1Circuitree&0 emits a redstone signal of a strength equal to the number of &1Circuitree&0 blocks consecutively above it. Any block from the tree can be used in the stack, including the sapling.

Calico Tree
An explosion absorber
The &1Calico Tree&0 is so cat-like, it scares more than just creepers away, it actually scares off any explosion at all. Any block from the tree can be used for this, including the sapling.

The Ritual of Gaia III
Sight, Sound, Strength, Power, Glory, Speed!
The ritual performed to face off against the soul of the Earth is a incredible challenge, which allows one to obtain &5Relics&0 and &1Gaia Spirits&0. As you fight, this ritual connects you to the &3Divine&0 by your struggles. So, maybe you could... invert that connection. Through that, you would force a fragment of the &3Divine&0 into your &1Priestly Emblem&0.
By using &1Divine Ritual Cores&0, you can modify the &4Ritual of Gaia&0 to do just that. These devices focus the energy of the &3Divine&0 into the Guardian, giving it power and health as the ritual plays out. The moment you slay the &4Guardian&0, that focused energy will leap into your &1Priestly Emblem&0. The power you could gain from this connection is staggering.
