The &1Holy Symbol&0 is the needed artifact for this connection, with what seems to be a wild storm of unrealized potential. Although crafted of simple materials, it has a ready acceptance of other magic. This is the gate to the &3Divine&0, and can be used to forge direct connections in the form of a &1Priestly Emblem&0. Wearing one will grant you more knowledge in this section.
A key to the zodiac
The connection the &1Priestly Emblems&0 give you are strong, but don't contain the full power you can harness. An interface to channel the power of a god on earth is required, to allow you to fully command the power you have gained. This interface is the &1Terrestrial Focus&0, a device which can cast &3Divine&0 spells.
Taking a level in Cleric
Even then, some may not wish to bind themselves to a god, but instead to fight them. By oversaturating the connection between a priest and their follower with &4Mana&0, you can fully cut it off. This can be accomplished by holding a &1Mortalstone&0, which forces &4Mana&0 into the soul of anyone around you.
The Kaj's weapon
Faith in Njord
Wind, sea, and sky
The &4Vanir&0 god of the fluid elements, &3Njord&0, seems like a worthy choice for your faith. Wielding his aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body hydrophobic, rising above any kind of fluid. You also gain attacks with the force of the wind, barreling your foes back with your every hit.

Movement Magic
The art of changing flows
The first spell that &3Njord&0's emblem grants, &1Rush of Wind&0, is a simple launching motion. It accelerates the caster in the direction they look, allowing for rudimentary flight. Any device that allows the user to glide seems an interesting combination with this.
The second spell of &3Njord&0, &1Galeforce&0, is a general protection spell. Most beings and projectiles will be pushed back from the player, giving them a sphere of safety.
