The third spell of &3Njord&0, &1Sudden Gust&0, allows for corralling animals without harming them. The being the player looks at will be forced back when it's cast, as if the player had hit them.
The final spell of &3Njord&0, &1Tempest Infusion&0, forces the strength of a storm into a shard of the sea, making &1Aquamarine&0. If you can somehow augment your emblem's power, the storm within the shard might be more potent.
It's so pretty
And back again
Use me underwater
And some panes

Faith in Idunn
Life, spring, and immortality
The &4Vanir&0 god of the living elements, &3Idunn&0, seems like a good choice to declare yourself for. Wielding her aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body naturally catalytic to the growth of trees, giving saplings around you an effect similar to &1Bonemeal&0. You can manually apply this affect by sneak-clicking with an empty hand.

The art of growth
The first spell that &3Idunn&0's emblem grants, &1Shield of Roots&0, is a powerful protection spell. While you have the &1Terrestrial Focus&0, for half a minute you will be unable to move, take, or deal melee damage. Giving the &1Focus&0 to someone else in that time will treat them as if they had been the one to cast the spell.
The second and final spell of &3Idunn&0, &1Life Catalyst&0, forces power into livingwood, twisting it to become &1Soulroot&0. If you can somehow augment your emblem's power, the root's lifeforce might be more potent.
