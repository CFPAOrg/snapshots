I have found a curious specimen on my travels.
This strange fellow needs further investigation.
Elated, I wanted to start at once with my research.
I was amazed at the wondrous nature of it.
The specimen twitched, while I inspected it more closely.
Strange markings on the underside made me curious.
This will be the talk of the society when I am done investigating.
After some prodding I discovered an interesting new lead.
I scratched my head at this discovery and questioned everything.
I thought my eyes deceived me, but there it was.
A previously unseen dot led me to question the specimen's classification.
My screams of frustration had the housekeeper look into my study in worry.
In a frenzy and on the verge of despair, I ripped up all the notes!
This... just doesn't make any sense!
It just cannot be. It didn't do that before!
The sledgehammer barely made a dent, so I sent for the chainsaw.
