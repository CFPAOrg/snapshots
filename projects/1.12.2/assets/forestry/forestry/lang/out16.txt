Click and done!
You can use the habitat buttons, the two climate bars in the upper center or the two text fields to change the targeted climate.
What do you need?
The habitat former uses energy to alter its temperature. And fluids like lava, water or crushed ice to alter its humidity and a small amount of its temperature.
Everything you want
Additional to the other options you can use the slot next to the habitat buttons to change the targeted climate to the preferred climate of a bee. Simply click with a bee on it.
Wrong Resource
The habitat former cannot reach the targeted humidity with the inserted fluid.
