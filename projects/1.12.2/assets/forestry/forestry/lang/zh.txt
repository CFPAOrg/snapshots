I have found a curious specimen on my travels.
This strange fellow needs further investigation.
Elated, I wanted to start at once with my research.
I was amazed at the wondrous nature of it.
The specimen twitched, while I inspected it more closely.
Strange markings on the underside made me curious.
This will be the talk of the society when I am done investigating.
After some prodding I discovered an interesting new lead.
I scratched my head at this discovery and questioned everything.
I thought my eyes deceived me, but there it was.
A previously unseen dot led me to question the specimen's classification.
My screams of frustration had the housekeeper look into my study in worry.
In a frenzy and on the verge of despair, I ripped up all the notes!
This... just doesn't make any sense!
It just cannot be. It didn't do that before!
The sledgehammer barely made a dent, so I sent for the chainsaw.
I swear it was looking at me, with its beady, cruel, little eyes.
Is that laughter? Do I hear laughter? Who is laughing here?
EUREKA!
Wondrous! My name will go down in history!
My colleagues will be impressed!
I will be the envy of everyone at the society!
Yes!
All is lost.
I consign my notes to the fire.
Why? I had made such great strides at first...
Failed. Again.
Oh my...

A full apiarist's suit will protect you from all negative bee effects.
Bee Suits!
Bees only work in biomes that suit their species. Use your portable analyzer and habitat locator to find out in which.
Choose your biome!
Crossbreeding drones and princesses of different species may net you offspring with a new species.
Breed your bees!
Any bee will need some type of flower in the vicinity. Some rather mundane flowers, others very exotic ones.
Bees need flowers
Only jubilant bees will produce their specialty. Make sure to have them in their preferred climate.
Make your bee happy!
Engines going into forced cooldown will also lose a significant chunk of their stored energy.
Cooldown means energy loss!
Main task of carpenters is the compression of your surplus resources. Many bulk blocks and items can be packaged into crates.
Crate your Surplus!
Engines are capable of buffering a lesser amount of energy if it cannot be transmitted to the target.
Buffering Energy!
An engine's energy output is measured in RF/t, which stands for "Redstone Flux per tick". Each second has 20 ticks.
Say Redstone Flux!
You can use a wide variety of fuels for your biogas engine: Biomass, seed oil, honey, milk and even water!
Use all the fuels!
Though you can use water in a biogas engine, it is terribly inefficient and will constantly consume lava.
Careful with water!
Different fuels will net you different energy outputs in a biogas engine. Outputs range from 10 RF/t to 50 RF/t.
Choose your fuel!
Contrary to peat-fired engines disabled biogas engines will not waste the biomass currently in the system.
Fuel is conserved
Peat-fired engines can use untreated peat, but they can also use bituminous peat to double their energy output.
Use all the fuels!
Disabled peat-fired engines continue to burn peat already removed from the stash without generating energy from it.
Beware wasting energy!
You can use batteries to run your electrical engines without needing to wire them up.
Charge those batteries!
Electrical engines can be outfitted with circuit boards to choke their power output to 10 RF/t and also reduce their energy demand.
Regulate Output
Jungle flowers are ferns or vines.
What's a jungle flower?
Netherwart are the nether flowers.
What's a nether flower?
Engines can overheat if the energy they produce is not consumed. Reaching melting point will force them into cooldown.
Beware Overheating!
Bio generators accept both biomass and biofuel. They are at their most efficient with biofuel.
Use all the fuels!
After some time, the Habitat Locator will point straight to the nearest suitable biome. When found, the indicator will spin.
Habitat Locator 101!
Many different kinds of foods can be made from honey and other bee products.
Grab foodstuff!
Peat can be farmed in automatic peat bogs, but when you start out, you might want to try harvesting a bit of peat by hand.
No Bog Needed!
Given the correct ingredients, your moistener can also create mossy cobblestone or mossy stone bricks.
Want some mossy cobble?
Machines of this type do not require any power to operate.
No power required
Bog earth directly adjacent to water will mature to peat. Use a shovel to harvest it.
Harvest Peat!
If you are stuck with remaining liquid in a machine's tank, you can click the tank with a pipette to empty it.
Empty tanks with the pipette
Sending letters costs stamps. To a base fee of 1n, every attachment adds another 1n of cost.
Pay the Ferryman
Even an unpowered raintank will collect rain. However to bottle the water, energy from an engine is required.
Bottling Requires Energy!
Your fermenter can not only create biomass, you can also use honeydew and liquid honey to make some short mead.
Get your energy drink!
Ash can be used to create fertilizer and is required to refine bituminous peat.
Use your ash!

Infests mostly plains in temperate climates; Mostly docile.|Beekeeping 101
"Hohoho!"|Merry bee
"How do bees even pollinate fungi?"|Mezz, Junior Apiarist
Hot and arid climates have forced this species to adapt to a degree which will not allow it to survive in significantly friendlier climates.|Beekeeping 101
"I remained austere and said to him: 'Not only a princess, but also a whole pile of emeralds for a measly drone? That's extortion!'|Beekeeping 101
"There is no more noble occupation in the world than to breed another bee."|Binnie, Apiarist
"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last."|Pahimar, beekeeper

Use a soldering iron to turn your tree farm into any kind of farm you like.
Program your farms!
Soil goes into the left slots, seeds or saplings into the right slots of the reservoir on the top right part.
Soil goes left, seeds go right!
Smooth sandstone, bricks or stone bricks create a platform the farm will build on.
Lay out your farmland!
All farms need fertilizer to work. Compost or mulch will not suffice.
Fertilizer needed!
Use gearboxes to attach engines or power lines to your farm.
Supply power!
Hatches are a pipe or tube's best friend. Use them to automate transport.
Batten down the hatches!
Apart from the automatic farms there are manual farms which will only maintain the farm, but not build it.
Manual farms!
Almost all farms require water. Use valve blocks for automation.

You can use the habitat buttons, the two climate bars in the upper center or the two text fields to change the targeted climate.
What do you need?
The habitat former uses energy to alter its temperature. And fluids like lava, water or crushed ice to alter its humidity and a small amount of its temperature.
Everything you want
Additional to the other options you can use the slot next to the habitat buttons to change the targeted climate to the preferred climate of a bee. Simply click with a bee on it.
Wrong Resource
The habitat former cannot reach the targeted humidity with the inserted fluid.
