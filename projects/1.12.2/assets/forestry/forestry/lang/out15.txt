Use a soldering iron to turn your tree farm into any kind of farm you like.
Program your farms!
Soil goes into the left slots, seeds or saplings into the right slots of the reservoir on the top right part.
Soil goes left, seeds go right!
Smooth sandstone, bricks or stone bricks create a platform the farm will build on.
Lay out your farmland!
All farms need fertilizer to work. Compost or mulch will not suffice.
Fertilizer needed!
Use gearboxes to attach engines or power lines to your farm.
Supply power!
Hatches are a pipe or tube's best friend. Use them to automate transport.
Batten down the hatches!
Apart from the automatic farms there are manual farms which will only maintain the farm, but not build it.
Manual farms!
Almost all farms require water. Use valve blocks for automation.
