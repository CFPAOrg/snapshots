Engines going into forced cooldown will also lose a significant chunk of their stored energy.
Cooldown means energy loss!
Main task of carpenters is the compression of your surplus resources. Many bulk blocks and items can be packaged into crates.
Crate your Surplus!
Engines are capable of buffering a lesser amount of energy if it cannot be transmitted to the target.
Buffering Energy!
An engine's energy output is measured in RF/t, which stands for "Redstone Flux per tick". Each second has 20 ticks.
Say Redstone Flux!
You can use a wide variety of fuels for your biogas engine: Biomass, seed oil, honey, milk and even water!
Use all the fuels!
Though you can use water in a biogas engine, it is terribly inefficient and will constantly consume lava.
Careful with water!
Different fuels will net you different energy outputs in a biogas engine. Outputs range from 10 RF/t to 50 RF/t.
Choose your fuel!
Contrary to peat-fired engines disabled biogas engines will not waste the biomass currently in the system.
Fuel is conserved
Peat-fired engines can use untreated peat, but they can also use bituminous peat to double their energy output.
Use all the fuels!
Disabled peat-fired engines continue to burn peat already removed from the stash without generating energy from it.
Beware wasting energy!
You can use batteries to run your electrical engines without needing to wire them up.
Charge those batteries!
Electrical engines can be outfitted with circuit boards to choke their power output to 10 RF/t and also reduce their energy demand.
Regulate Output

Netherwart are the nether flowers.

Engines can overheat if the energy they produce is not consumed. Reaching melting point will force them into cooldown.
Beware Overheating!
Bio generators accept both biomass and biofuel. They are at their most efficient with biofuel.
