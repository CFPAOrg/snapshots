I swear it was looking at me, with its beady, cruel, little eyes.

Wondrous! My name will go down in history!
My colleagues will be impressed!

A full apiarist's suit will protect you from all negative bee effects.
Bee Suits!
Bees only work in biomes that suit their species. Use your portable analyzer and habitat locator to find out in which.
Choose your biome!
Crossbreeding drones and princesses of different species may net you offspring with a new species.
Breed your bees!
Any bee will need some type of flower in the vicinity. Some rather mundane flowers, others very exotic ones.
Bees need flowers
Only jubilant bees will produce their specialty. Make sure to have them in their preferred climate.
Make your bee happy!
