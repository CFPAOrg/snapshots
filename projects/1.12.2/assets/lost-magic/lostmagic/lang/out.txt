Ring of Nutrition
Eating food is such a scam! Why do I have to eat things just to eat more things later? And don't even get me started on having to eat §ogood§r things! Eating some melon slices I picked up off the ground is perfectly healthy!<BR>Perhaps I can find a way to improve my ability to derive sustenance through infusion.
At last! I've created a ring that will improve the nutritious value of most things I eat as long as I wear it! Some foods are a bit too exotic for the ring to process, and cake is just TOO worthless, but now even cookies and melon slices will be at least a little filling.
