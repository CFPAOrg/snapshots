Orechid Vacuam
Empty on the inside
Orechid Vacuam
Creates end ores from end stone
The &1Orechid&0 is a great flower. The ability to create raw ores with &4Mana&0 can be a great boon to any sedentary botanist's life. It, however, can't create ores from the &4End&0. Getting that sorted out is easy, by switching the petals a bit, it'll create &4End&0 ores in &1End Stone&0 instead. The flower must be in the &4End&0 to work.
&oWhy is there so much emptiness?&r.
