Loot Bags
When provided with eggs (either manually, or by any means of automation), and if at least a single output slot is empty, it will check how good an egg is, compare it with eggs already kept there, and put all but best eggs in output slot.\nEach of the slots is only checking for one of the 3 stats, so it'll allow to select the preferred stat. (It still needs some work, it doesn't stack eggs with same stats from 2 different chickens.)
With the help of miniaturization and magic, this block provides perfect conditions to live for 9 pixies. Over time, this block is going to accumulate pixie dust, which is a nice addition to providing housing for those small, annoying creatures. Pixie dust is going to be collected faster the more pixies are there. Pixie dust extraction can be automated. This block accepts pixie jars as well as some mob capturing items.
(Wuss mode needs to be enabled in Thaumcraft options for this block to be possible to unlock and for it to work!) If this block is placed in area with high enough Flux content, and there's more Flux than Vis, it will drain Flux over time and create Void Seeds. There is, however, a chance for them to turn into a Primordial Pearl. The chance is increased the more Void Seeds are there and this can only happen when Void Seeds are created - there's no point in holding an entire stack of them there. Primordial pearls will be created weak, but will increase in strength as Flux is drained by Void Creator.

Void Creator
I have a strange feeling that I'm missing something, or rather, the world I'm in is. It feels like it's too safe to access more... "advanced" research. I should try to to look deeper into that.
That's it! Based on what I've gathered from the Crimson Cultists I managed to create a device that's going to create a rare and powerful material - Void Seeds - from the flux in the area it's placed in. It requires more Flux than Vis to be present, as well as enough of it to start the process.
Focus Effect: Size Change
I'm fascinated by the potions capable of changing one's size. I'm going to start by analyzing the Kobold Ring, as it's connected to the concept of changing the size of a person.
Now I have access to the effects of size changing. This could come in handy when trying to move through tight spaces, or when tryinng to weaken my foes.
Focus Effect: Size Stabilization
Considering I've managed to gain the ability of changing size of creatures, I wonder if I could achieve an effect reverting the size back to original?
It was slightly harder than changing the size itself, but I've achieved it. Being able to return back to my original size should be rather useful. It should at least stop me from hitting my head every time I'm going thorough the doors...
Focus Effect: Size Stealing
Changing the size of others or myself is useful, but I wonder if I'll be able to use for more combat focused situations?
I've achieved an effect of stealing the size of my foes, which will both weaken them and strengthen me in the process.

Orechid Vacuam
Creates end ores from end stone
The &1Orechid&0 is a great flower. The ability to create raw ores with &4Mana&0 can be a great boon to any sedentary botanist's life. It, however, can't create ores from the &4End&0. Getting that sorted out is easy, by switching the petals a bit, it'll create &4End&0 ores in &1End Stone&0 instead. The flower must be in the &4End&0 to work.
&oWhy is there so much emptiness?&r.
