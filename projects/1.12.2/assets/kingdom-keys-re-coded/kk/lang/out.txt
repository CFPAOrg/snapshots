a synthesis table or by speaking with a Moogle
Creation of a Keyblade also requires a synthesis recipe
which can be obtained from dungeons or as a rare random hostile mob drop
How to equip it (Comming soon)
Magic spells unlock useful powers
They are rare drops from mobs
There are 6 known magics you can get
Each one has it's own power and work different
When you see a magic in orange it means it
is going to consume all your MP
This is the MP bar
Each magic consume a different amount
of MP and the bar will decrease
Once the bar hits 0 it will become pink
and will start to slowly regenerate
Meanwhile no magic can be used until
it recharges and becomes blue again
Drive forms grant useful powers
for a limited amount of time
There are 5 forms you can get
each one with their own growth ability
There is also a hidden form
which has some dark powers...
This is the drive gauge
once it fills it increases a level
The max level is 3 but you can
increase the limit by leveling the forms
to level 7 and killing the enderdragon
In order to activate a drive form
You must have a main keychain equipped
And if the drive form uses 2 keyblades
You must have another keychain for it's slot
Once you are in a drive form
the drive gauge will be replaced
by this form gauge, once it depletes
the drive form will revert automatically
