The keyblades are the main weapon type in the mod
It's one of the few weapons which can defeat heartless
and the only one to collect hearts
Keyblades can be obtained through creation at either
a synthesis table or by speaking with a Moogle
Creation of a Keyblade also requires a synthesis recipe
which can be obtained from dungeons or as a rare random hostile mob drop
How to equip it (Comming soon)
Magic spells unlock useful powers
They are rare drops from mobs
There are 6 known magics you can get
Each one has it's own power and work different
When you see a magic in orange it means it
is going to consume all your MP
This is the MP bar
Each magic consume a different amount
of MP and the bar will decrease
Once the bar hits 0 it will become pink
and will start to slowly regenerate
Meanwhile no magic can be used until
it recharges and becomes blue again
Drive forms grant useful powers
for a limited amount of time
There are 5 forms you can get
each one with their own growth ability
There is also a hidden form
which has some dark powers...
This is the drive gauge
once it fills it increases a level
The max level is 3 but you can
increase the limit by leveling the forms
to level 7 and killing the enderdragon
In order to activate a drive form
You must have a main keychain equipped
And if the drive form uses 2 keyblades
You must have another keychain for it's slot
Once you are in a drive form
the drive gauge will be replaced
by this form gauge, once it depletes
the drive form will revert automatically
Welcome to Kingdom Keys!
You are right now in the Station of Awakening
Here you have to make a choice
Stand on top of the pedestal to make the choice
