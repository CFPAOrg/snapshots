Components are vital parts for creating all sorts of blocks and items detailed in this book.
The Logistic Wrench is a tool used for everything from rotating machines and changing what direction escalators move.
Iron Dowels are small iron sticks which are used for everything from creating rollers, catwalks, motors, and more.
Motor Sets are used for the creation of all kinds of machines, and more specifically, conveyors.

Conveyors are complex mechanisms used for transporting items, blocks, and even creatures around the world.
The Stone Conveyor is a cheap, albeit very slow, way of moving items around. It cannot center entities or insert items into inventories.
Normal Conveyors are conveyors which move items, blocks, and creatures horizontally on the ground. They automatically center entities, and also insert items into inventories.
Vertical Conveyors are conveyors which move items, blocks, and creatures vertically upwards. They also automatically center entities.
Escalators are conveyors which are stair-shaped and move items, blocks, and creatures diagonally upwards. They also automatically center entities.
The Filter is a complex machine used for moving items and blocks of certain types in your chosen direction.
The Alternator is a simple machine which alternates the direction of any items (up to a stack of 64) which are inserted.
The Junction is an improved Alternator which lets you control its direction via redstone.
