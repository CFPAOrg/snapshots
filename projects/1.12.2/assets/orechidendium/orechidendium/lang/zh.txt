Orechid Endium
Creates End ores from End Stone
The &1Orechid&0 is a great flower. The ability to create raw ores with &4Mana&0 can be a great boon to any sedentary botanist's life. It, however, can't create ores from the &4End&0. Getting that sorted out is easy, by switching the petals a bit, it'll create &4End&0 ores in &1End Stone&0 instead. The flower must be in &4The End&0 to function.
