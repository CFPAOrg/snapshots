JJ Skill is a mod that brings more than 30 skills to the world of Minecraft, so to make it feel like an MMORPG. Skills will be both for combat (PVP and PVE) and for farming. By collecting the Red Experience Points looted by mobs, you will be able to raise every skill up to level 10. To every level will correspond ever better stats. Thanks to the use of the Press, you'll be able to imprint on your weapons any of your learnt skills.
The mod adds a new type of Red Experience, that behaves in the same way as the classic EXP in vanilla Minecraft. Accumulating experience, you'll be able to train your Skills.  To view the accumulated experience, press the key
It is possible to obtain more experience by drinking from the experience bottles you can find in dungeon chests.
This mod adds 15 weapons (3 Swords, 3 Bows, 3 Battle Axes, 3 Daggers, and 3 Staves). The skills can be associated to some weapons/items up to 3 skills each. You're able to bring with you up to 3 skilled weapons/items. To change the selected skill, press the key
