To create a star put Gunpowder and any Minecraft dye in your crafting grid. For a shape effect add one of these: Fire Charge, Gold Nugget, Head (any), Feather. For additional effects add Glowstone Dust and/or a Diamond.
The minimum ingredients for Firework Rockets is one Paper and up to three Gunpowder. Gunpowder determines the flight duration. Up to seven Firework Stars can be added. Without a Firework Star there is no explosion effect.
