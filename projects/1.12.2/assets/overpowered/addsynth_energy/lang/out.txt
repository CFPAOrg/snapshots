Use Energy Wire to connect all your machines together to transfer energy.
This will store any excess energy that you generate, up to 1 million units of Energy.
This machine works just like a regular Furnace except it runs off of electricity. 1,000 units Energy will perform 1 smelting operation.
The Compressor is used to compress metal ingots into metal plates.
This machine can interface with other Energy APIs in order to transfer energy to/from other mods.
