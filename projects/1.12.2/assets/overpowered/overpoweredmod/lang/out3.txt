§cBeware§r: Traveling to the Unknown Dimension is still buggy. There's a chance you may spawn in the air and fall to your death! (I believe this occurs when you enter for the first time because the dimension hasn't loaded yet.) We recommend entering the portal in Creative Mode, or disabling the Portal in the config. (Boots with Feather Falling IV won't work. I've tried.) If you're quick to enter the portal a second time before the portal goes away you might spawn on the ground. Enter at your own risk! This will get fixed in a later update.
