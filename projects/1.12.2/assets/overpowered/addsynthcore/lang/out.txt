Scythes are used to cut leaves off of trees very quickly. They are mined as though you mined them by hand.
Press keys on your keyboard to change notes. Arrange notes on the grid, and press PLAY to hear the current Music Box. Activate a Music Box with a redstone signal. When one Music Box is done playing, it will search in the NEXT direction for another Music Box and play that one.
The Music Sheet can be used to copy Music Box data to other Music Boxes. Right-click a Music Box to copy data. When the Music Sheet has data, right-click Music Boxes to paste. Right-clicking without looking at a Music Box will clear the data.
